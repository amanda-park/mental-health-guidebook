    <!--Fragment Overview-->

    <string name="aboutMeOverview">Hi there! My name is Amanda. I\'m a nerd, mental health advocate, and a lover of all types of gaming.
        \n\nI recently graduated with my Master\'s in Statistics, and a lot of stressful stuff happened with that experience where receiving mental health treatment would have been beneficial. However, due to limited on-campus resources and a lack of insurance, affordable (let alone quality) mental health treatment was nearly impossible for me to access. So I was in an unfortunate bind. I know that I am not the only one who has come across an issue like this.
        \n\nMy solution to this problem was to read up on a lot of different books that were mental health related and regularly sat on therapist\'s bookshelves. (Apparently this is called bibliotherapy, and you can find a lot of them in the Resources tab of this app!) But as I began reading these books, I noticed a habit where I would read what was in them and then promptly forget the relevant content in a time of need. So I wanted a way to refer to the information I thought was relevant from the books in a convenient manner.
        \n\nThus, the idea for this app was born. I\'ve coded a fair bit throughout my collegiate journey due to my mathematics background, but this is the first full-blown Android application I\'ve built. I tried to add features that others might find useful (such as the self-care quote bubble), but I\'m not a professional coder. Regardless, I\'ve tried to keep the app as free from shady suggestions as possible (sorry, no photosynthesis diet allowed) and to keep the knowledge listed within both useful and understandable for anyone.
        \n\nIf you would like to know more about me or connect professionally, here\'s my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkamanda/" target="_top">LinkedIn</a> account. Thank you again for checking out this app!

    <string name="actOverview">Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT, typically pronounced as the word act) is a form of counseling and a branch of clinical behavior analysis. It is an empirically-based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility.</string>

    <string name="cbtOverview">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method of therapy that focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors that might affect someone. By recognizing the distorted thoughts and developing healthy coping mechanisms that target solving current problems, one will begin to experience relief from symptoms. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its use has been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.</string>

    <string name="dbtOverview">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a variation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy developed to treat Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT emphasizes the psychosocial aspects of treatment. The main components of DBT include a support-oriented environment, cognitive-based treatment, and a collaborative approach in what are usually weekly group treatments and weekly individual treatments. The four main modules are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, and emotional regulation.</string>

    <string name="emdrOverview">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an integrative psychotherapy approach that has been extensively researched and proven effective for the treatment of various types of psychological and physical trauma that one has experienced in their lives. Through the use of bilateral stimulation (similar to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep), trauma that is stored in the body can be reprocessed so that healing can occur. The bilaterial stimulation can be achieved through eye movements, buzzers in each hand, or tapping on the body. Some mental exercises that can be used to prepare yourself for EMDR therapy are below:</string>

    <string name="emdrOverview2">A main component of EMDR therapy is related to resolving trauma. The buttons below will focus on the key points I look away from a few different trauma books I read while researching this realm.</string>

    <string name="emotionalFirstAidOverview">Emotional first aid is best used when treating a minor emotional trouble, that if left untreated, can fester into a more serious mental concern. Some of the troubles that qualify for these are the following:</string>

    <string name="habitsOverview">Habits are an automatic repetition of behavior. They can be healthy when they are for good behavior and detrimental when they enforce negative actions. The best way to reevaluate and enforce better habits can be seen in the algorithm  which covers the main four habit-building steps in order:</string>

    <string name="ifsOverview">Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a therapy that identifies and addresses the many sub-personalities (or families) within each person\'s mental system. These sub-personalities consist of wounded parts and painful emotions such as anger and shame, and parts that try to control and protect the person from the pain of the wounded parts. The sub-personalities are often in conflict with each other and with one\'s core Self, a concept that describes the confident, compassionate, whole person that is at the core of every individual. IFS focuses on healing the wounded parts and restoring mental balance and harmony by changing the dynamics that create discord among the sub-personalities and the Self.</string>

    <string name="mbsrOverview">Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an eight-week course that focuses on introducing mindfulness practices and yoga exercises into one\'s everyday life. While it is not specifically a therapeutic technique, following the protocol has been shown to ease a lot of mental health problems and lead to a higher quality of life overall. Below are some common meditations practiced in MBSR, but also some modifications to make to practice trauma-informed mindfulness and how to use mindfulness in everyday life.</string>

    <string name="schemaOverview">Schema therapy is an integrative psychotherapy combining theory and techniques from previously existing therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoanalytic object relations theory, attachment theory, and Gestalt therapy. The goal is to identify maladaptive schemas (ie, thought patterns) in childhood that led to unhealthy coping mechanisms as an adult, and to overwrite them to meet one\'s emotional needs that are likely being neglected.</string>

    <string name="schemaOverview2">The 18 main schema are listed above. Below are general treatment strategies used when undergoing schema therapy:</string>

    <string name="other_directedness">Other-Directedness</string>
    <string name="impaired_limits">Impaired Limits</string>
    <string name="impaired_autonomy_and_performance">Impaired Autonomy and Performance</string>
    <string name="disconnection_and_rejection">Disconnection and Rejection</string>
    <string name="overvigilance_and_inhibition">Overvigilance and Inhibition</string>

    <string name="welcomeOverview">Swipe to the right and you\'ll find a list of various therapies, general guidelines about them, and some exercises within that can help relieve mental distress. Below that are some treatments you can implement to improve your day to day life, including building better habits and practicing proper emotional first aid. I hope you find this app useful!
        \n\nDisclaimer: This is <u><b>NOT</b></u> a substitute for seeing a licensed medical professional. And if you are feeling suicidal, please look at <a href="http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html" target="_top">this website</a> for hotlines and other immediate assistance.</string>

    <string name="therapistOverview">Finding a good mental health professional can be a challenge, even for those of us more fortunate that have access to treatment. I hope this application can offer some insight as to what types of therapy may appeal to you in particular, but there is no replacement for an expert opinion.
        \n\n<b>Where Do I Find A Therapist?</b>
        \n\nSearching Psychology Today\'s therapist <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists">directory</a> can lead you in the right direction to finding a therapist. You can search based on insurance, issues you\'d like to work on, and types of therapy.
        \n\nFriends and family are a good resource to seek out, as they may be able to refer you to someone in particular for treatment. And assuming you trust their judgment, the therapist you see will likely be a quality one.
        \n\n<b>Qualities to Look For In A Therapist</b>
        \n\n<i>Do You Feel Comfortable And Heard Talking To Them?</i>
        \n\nIf you\'re talking with a therapist and your gut feeling is telling you that you are not properly being listened to, do not ignore it - this likely means that the therapist is a bad fit and that you should look elsewhere for mental health treatment. If a therapist talks more than you do in a session or it ever feels like you are talking to a brick wall, these are warning signs that treatment isn\'t going well.
        \n\n<i>Are They An Effective Communicator?</i>
        \n\nQuality therapists can express themselves in such a way that you can understand why you are feeling the distress that you are. They will also pay attention between sessions and follow up to see if you did any homework that may have been assigned, or at the very least, check in with you to see how treatment is unfolding overall.
        \n\n<i>Are They Adaptable?</i>
        \n\nThrough the course of therapy, your needs may change and your symptoms may vary in intensity. A good therapist can adjust their treatment given newfound information accordingly. A bad therapist will have a one-size-fits all approach for every client that comes in the door and refuses to deviate from that course of treatment.
        \n\n<i>Are They Respectful?</i>
        \n\nIf a therapist makes insensitive remarks about a person\'s race, gender, sexuality, religion, or ethnic background, they are not a quality therapist.
        \n\n<i>Are They Ethical?</i>
        \n\nIs confidentiality respected? Is the therapist making a romantic advance on you? Are the financial practices shady? Don\'t stick out therapy with this individual if you sense any of these things happening.
        \n\n<i>Are They Experienced With Your Issues?</i>
        \n\nNot all therapists can treat everyone effectively. For example, if you have issues with addiction, a therapist aimed towards treating marital problems won\'t be an ideal fit off the bat. If you look your therapist up on PsychologyToday (linked above) you can see where their expertise lies.

    <!--ACT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="actConnectionExercisesOverview"><b>Connection With The Environment</b>
        \n\nSet your phone down for a second and become aware of your surroundings. Notice as much as you can about what you can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. Ask yourself the following:
        \n• What’s the temperature?
        \n• Is the air moving or still?
        \n• What is the lighting like?
        \n\nCount at least five sounds you can hear, five objects you can see and five things you can feel that are currently against your body (such as how your shirt feels, the air on your face, your feet on the floor, your back against the chair, etc). Notice what happens.
        \n\n<b>Awareness of The Body</b>
        \n\nConnect with your body. Notice where your legs and arms are and the position of your spine. Scan your body internally from head to toe; notice what you can feel throughout your body. Put your phone down, close your eyes and do this for a minute.
        \n\n<b>Awareness of The Breath</b>
        \n\nConnect with your breathing patterns. Notice the rise and fall of your rib cage and the air moving through your nose. Follow the air in through your nose. Notice your lungs expanding and your abdomen pushing outward. Feel the air leave as the lungs deflate. Set aside any distractions, close your eyes and do this for a minute.
        \n\n<b>Awareness of Sounds</b>
        \n\nFocus on the sounds you can hear. Notice the sounds coming from you, the sounds coming from the room and the sounds coming from outside the room. Close your eyes and do this for a minute and see what happens.
        \n\n<b>Notice Five Things</b>
        \n\nThis exercise helps to center yourself and connect with your environment. Practise it a few times every day, especially whenever you find yourself getting caught up in your thoughts and feelings. You’ll find that it brings you back to the here and now. The steps include:
        \n\n• Pause for a moment.
        \n• Look around and notice five objects you can see.
        \n• Listen carefully and notice five sounds you can hear.
        \n• Notice five things you can physically feel.
        \n\nYou can develop this skill further by going for a daily walk and spending the whole time noticing what you can see, hear, smell and physically feel (and refocusing whenever you realise you’ve been ‘disconnected’).
        \n\n<n>Connect With Your Morning Routine</n>
        \n\nPick an activity that’s a part of your daily morning routine, such as brushing your teeth, combing your hair or taking a shower. Totally focus on what you are doing, using all your five senses. For example, when you’re in the shower notice how the water sounds when it sprays out of the nozzle, the temperature of the water and how it feels when it hits your body, and the smell of the shampoo in your hair. When your mind begins to wander during the habit, acknowledge that your mind wandered and refocus back on the five senses when doing the activity.
    </string>

    <string name="cognitiveDefusionOverview">Remember that defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. Must accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them. But some strategies that can be used to defuse thoughts are the following:
        \n\n<b>I’m Having the Thought That</b>
        \n\nTo begin this exercise, first bring to mind an upsetting thought that takes the form ‘I am X’ (an example includes I am stupid). Preferably pick a thought that often recurs and bothers you when it does. Now hold that thought in your mind and actively believe it as much as you can. Focus on it for a bit and notice your response.
        \n\n<b>Musical Thinking</b>
        \n\nBring to mind a negative self-judgement that commonly bothers you when it comes up. Hold that thought in your mind and really believe it as much as you can for a few seconds. Then imagine taking that same thought and singing it to yourself to the tune of a catchy jingle, like Happy Birthday, Jingle Bells, . Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens.
        \n\n<b>Naming Stories</b>
        \n\nIdentify your mind’s favourite stories, then give them names, such as the <b>Thank Mind</b> story. Usually, there will be a few variations on a story\'s theme. When your stories show up, be sure to acknowledge them by name. You don’t have to challenge it or push it away, nor do you have to give it much attention. Simply let it come and go as it pleases, while you channel your energy into doing something that matters to you.
        \n\n<b>Silly Voices Technique</b>
        \n\nWhen your mind starts coming up with the stories you labeled in the previous part, simply thank it. Do not give the thanks in a sarcastic and/or aggressive manner - do it with warmth and humour, and with a genuine appreciation for the capacity your mind has to produce endless thoughts.
        \n\n<i>I\'m an idiot</i>
        \n\nWhen dealing with recurrent negative thoughts, focus on the thought for a few seconds, believing it as much as possible. Then pick a cartoon character with a humorous voice, such as Spongebob, Mickey Mouse, or Bugs Bunny. Now bring the troubling thought to mind, but instead hear it in the cartoon character’s voice, as if that character were audibly saying your thoughts. This can also be done with characters from movies such as Darth Vader, Gollum or any character that has a distinct voice that you would find funny.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalPhasesOverview"><b>First, A Significant Event</b>
        \n\nAn emotion is triggered by some sort of significant event. This event may have an internal cause, like a distressing memory, a painful sensation or a disturbing thought. It may also be caused by an external event that triggers one of your five senses. Either way, your brain notices this event and warns you that it\’s important.
        \n\n<b>Second, A Call To Action</b>
        \n\nThe brain starts to evaluate the event. It will try to determine if the event is beneficial or not. Meanwhile, the brain prepares the body to either to approach or to avoid the event. In this phase, there is no distinctive ‘feeling’ in the usual sense of the word. If the brain determines the event is harmful, the <b>Third, The Mind Tries to Figure Things Out</b> is triggered, and our body prepares to either attack, run, or freeze in place. If the brain judges the event positively, our body prepares to approach and explore it. And as our body gets ready for action, we experience a variety of sensations and urges.
        \n\n<i>fight-flight-freeze response</i>
        \n\nThe brain starts attaching words, ideas and meanings to the changes happening within our body. For example, the mind may label our sensations as a certain emotion. And what our mind tells us about these sensations has a significant impact on how we relate to them. For example, imagine two people on a rollercoaster. One would say that they are terrified, and the other would say they are exhilarated. However, both are experiencing the same physical changes (raised adrenaline levels, increased blood pressure), the same physical sensations (churning stomach, pounding heart), and the same urges (to scream). Their subjective experiences just vary depending on what their minds tell them, so it really pays to be mindful of how you label certain sensations in your body.
    </string>

    <string name="tvScreenOverview">Bring an unpleasant image to mind and notice how it’s affecting you. Now imagine a television screen across the room from you. Put the bothersome image on the television screen. Distort the image when it\'s on the TV screen. Some examples include:
        \n• Flip it upside down
        \n• Turn it on its side
        \n• Spin it around and around
        \n• Stretch the image beyond the bounds of the screen
        \n• Turn the colour down on the TV so the image is black and white.
        \n• Alternatively, turn the colour and brightness up until the image looks ridiculously lurid
        \n\nIf the image is more like a movie clip rather than a still image, try the following TV adjustments to the video clip:
        \n• Play the clip in slow motion
        \n• Play it backwards in slow motion
        \n• Play it forwards at double speed; then reverse it at double speed.
        \n\nThe goal is to make the image seem harmless by recognizing that it\'s only an image, and nothing more. If the image still has not been defused yet, you can try the following techniques as well:
        \n\n<b>Silly Subtitles or Voiceovers</b>
        \n\nKeeping that image on the television screen, add a humorous subtitle or voice-over to it. For example, if the disturbing image is regarding a romantic rejection, the subtitle can say "Wow! I Just Got Dumped!" or something that resonates with you. If the image is linked to a story that you’ve already named, then use that name on the subtitle or voice-over.
        \n\n<b>Musical Soundtrack</b>
        \n\nKeeping that image on the television screen, add a musical soundtrack in the background that you find suitable. Try out a few different genres, like jazz, rap, country, rock or your favourite songs.
        \n\n<b>Shifting Locations</b>
        \n\nVisualise the image in a variety of different locations. You can visualize the image hanging on a wall in France, on a blimp flying above a sports stadium, on the T-shirt of your favorite celebrity, as an annoying pop-up ad on a website, or as a bumper sticker on a tractor trailer. The possibilities are endless as to where to visualize this.
        \n\n<b>Changing Genres</b>
        \n\nThis technique works best with video clip images. Try playing the clip so that it matches different film genres. For example, imagine it as a buddy cop movie, a Western, a reality TV show, an anime, or a musical. Each time you change genres, change the set pieces and acting style accordingly, but don’t try to alter what actually happens. Keep the narrative the same. Play these scenes repeatedly until it loses its hold over you.

    <!--CBT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="approvalAddictionOverview">Remember that your worth cannot be determined based on whether you are approved by others or not. It needs to come from within. If people-pleasing and other tendencies that indicate your approval seeking nature get in the way of your everyday life, follow these steps:
        \n\n• Run cost-benefit analysis on whether it\'s worth keeping spinelessness/approval addiction behavior
        \n\n• Rewrite silent assumptions so they are more realistic and self-enhancing
        \n\n• Create a self-respect blueprint by writing an essay about why it\'s unnecessary to live in fear of disapproval or criticism
        \n\n• Utilize verbal techniques, such as disarming and being vulnerable
        \n\n• Remember rejection is not your fault! For example, romantic rejection is simply just not fitting other person\'s preferences. Don\'t sell self short, express genuine compliments to others, show interest in other people and their desires.
        \n\n• When recovering from rejection, give yourself a specific time frame to feel miserable about the situation, but do not endlessly ruminate. When thoughts come up past that time frame, find distortions and do your best to mentally move on from the situation.
    </string>

    <string name="cognitiveDistortionOverview"><b>All-or-nothing thinking</b>
        \n\nYou see your situation as black and white, you want to have everything or nothing. Everything is unreachable perfection, and consequently you feel like you have nothing. But that’s far from the truth.
        \n\n<b>Overgeneralization</b>
        \n\nYou generalize one bad event that happened to you (rejection, for example) as a never-ending pattern that you can’t do anything about.
        \n\n<b>Mental Filter</b>
        \n\nYou see only negatives and minuses and ignore all the benefits and pluses.
        \n\n<b>Discounting the Positives</b>
        \n\nYou give zero value to your past accomplishments, strengths and positive qualities. They don’t count, because everyone has them.
        \n\n<b>Jumping to Conclusions, Mind reading, and Catastrophizing</b>
        \n\nYou predict that things will turn out badly, even if you don’t have any proof for that, or you assume people will react negatively or reject you, again without any proof. Catastrophizing is jumping to negative conclusions on steroids.
        \n\n<b>Magnification / Minimization</b>
        \n\nYou make a big deal out of small, not really important details, or you shrink things that are important to almost nothing.
        \n\n<b>Emotional Reasoning</b>
        \n\nYou draw the conclusion that how you temporarily feel is who you really are. For example: “I feel like I didn\’t write this well enough, so I must really be a bad writer”.
        \n\n<b>“Should statements”</b>
        \n\nYou criticize yourself and others based on what you or they should, must, or have to do. You moralize to others and yourself.
        \n\n<b>Labeling</b>
        \n\nYou put a negative label on your identity based on perceived shortcomings, even if they’re not real. “I’m a complete loser”, would be a nice example.
        \n\n<b>Blame and personalization</b>
        \n\nYou blame yourself for things that were not your responsibility or you blame others for things that were your responsibility. Or you assume that no matter what other people do, they do it to block you or harm you personally. You also constantly compare yourself to others.
        \n\n<b>Always be right</b>
        \n\nBeing wrong is simply unthinkable to you. You try to prove that every one of your actions or thoughts is correct. You try to persuade others to think the same way you do.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of fairness</b>
        \n\nYou feel resentful or envious, because you think you know better what would be a fairer situation, than other people do.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of change</b>
        \n\nYou expect other people to change or the world to change more to your liking and wants. And your happiness seems to depend on that kind of change.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of being a good person</b>
        \n\nYou expect being a good person and sacrificing for others will pay off somehow and when it doesn\’t you feel bitter.
        \n\n<b>Hindsight thinking and what-ifs</b>
        \n\nYou look back at your past decisions and make judgments how you could handle things better. But you handled it according to your knowledge and experience at that time. In the same way, you might constantly ask yourself “what if” about your future, but you’re never satisfied with the answer.
        \n\n<b>Control error</b>
        \n\nYou either see yourself as a helpless being with no personal power or control. Consequently, you feel stuck and externally controlled. The other extreme is if you feel responsible for everything and want to control everything.
        \n\n<b>Unrealistic comparison</b>
        \n\nYou compare yourself with other people, viewing them better as you are, not considering different starting points, life circumstances, genetic advantages, random luck events etc.
    </string>

    <string name="antiProcrastinationOverview"><b>Daily Activity Schedule</b>
        \n\nWhen you are feeling disorganized and are not sure what to be working on, plan out every hour of the day with a schedule similar to the one seen <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/schedule-behavioral-activation.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Anti-Procrastination Sheet</b>
        \n\nIf the tasks you are doing feel unrewarding, write down why they seem so and put those predictions to the test when you are doing said tasks. The goal is to take a task, break it down into little steps, try to predict how difficult and satisfactory each part of the task will be, and then check in to see how difficult and satisfying the task was in reality.

        \n\nWhen you are not feeling like doing things alone, predict the enjoyment you will gain from doing the activity beforehand, then do it and see how you feel after doing it. Also see how being alone or with others impacts the activity.

        \n\n<b>But-Rebuttal Method</b>
        \n\nWhen you find yourself giving yourselves excuses for not doing a task, combat those buts with logical and realistic rebuttals until you can feel comfortable actually doing the task and not question your capability about doing so. A sheet showing how to do so can be seen <a href="http://www.elizakingsford.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/But-Rebuttal-Method.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Self-Endorsement Method</b>
        \n\nWhen you\'re feeling like what you do isn\'t worth much, write down the self-downing thoughts and find the distorted patterns in them, while also listing accomplishments you have accrued each day. An example of such can be seen <a href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/learn-to-endorse-yourself/">here</a>
        \n\n<b>TIC-TOC Technique</b>
        \n\nWhen a task is thought about in a self-defeating manner, instead, think about the things that need to be done in a task-oriented way rather than a task-interfering way. An example sheet can be seen <a href="https://classroommentalhealth.org/exercises/materials/tic-toc-technique.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Breaking Tasks Down into Small, Actionable Steps</b>

        \n\n<b>Motivation Without Coercion</b>
        \n\nDo you feel forced to do a lot of the tasks that are in your life? If you are feeling guilty and duty bound, eliminate the <i>shoulds</i> one might throw out when giving yourself instructions, and try to find the joy in the task in terms of what you want to do, rather than what you must do.

        \n\n<b>Disarming Technique</b>
        \n\nIf you are feeling like you are being pressured into something by someone else and are resentful about it, assertively agree with their opinion and tell them you are capable of doing it on your own. This will help you to unconsciously procrastinate the task. To learn more to resist getting pushed around and this technique, check <a href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/disarming-technique/">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Can\'t Lose System</b>
        \n\nWhen you are fearing failure and that is the root cause of your procrastination, write down any negative consequences of said failure and adopt a healthy coping strategy ahead of time by recognizing the cognitive distortions in your thoughts and replacing them with a realistic perspective on the situation.

    <string name="cantOverview">When you are feeling incapable of something due to negative cognitions, set up an experiment and try to prove the can\'ts you believe in. If the can\'t you believe in is a particularly broad statement, try to break it down into smaller things you do not believe you are capable of and test those one by one.
    </string>

    <string name="countWhatCountsOverview">When you are lacking confidence or are feeling incapable of doing stuff on your own, count the number of times you can do things on your own. By quantifying your positive actions with a counter app on your phone (or a manual wrist counter), you can see and value your own positive contributions you have made in your life. This will also help reduce dwelling on inadequacies, whether they be perceived or real, and help build confidence in the abilities you currently do possess.

    <string name="cognitiveReframingOverview">Cognitive reframing (also known as cognitive restructuring) is a technique that allows you to reprogram your brain and see situations differently. The main tactic to remember when trying to change your view on a situation is to use the ABC-DE acronym.
        \n\n<b>Accurate Description</b>
        \n\nWrite down the event, and keep it free from cognitive distortions.
        \n\n<b>Beliefs</b>
        \n\nDescribe what you think about the situation as accurately as possible. For example, ask yourself:
        \n• What caused the situation to happen?
        \n• What does the event say about you?
        \n• What do you think should happen?
        \n\n<b>Consequences</b>
        \n\nConsider the negative side effects of this chosen situation. Ask questions like these to yourself:
        \n• What were the automatic negative thoughts?
        \n• What were the feelings about the event?
        \n• What were automatic actions taken in response to the situation?
        \n\n<i>Cognitive Reframing starts here</i>
        \n\n<b>Dispute</b>
        \n\nChallenge your thoughts and beliefs to see the reality of the situation more accurately. Questions to ask include:
        \n• If the same thing happened to your best friend or someone you love, what would be your interpretation of the event then?
        \n• How would [enter the name of your role model] interpret this situation?
        \n• What are other potential explanations besides blaming yourself?
        \n• What was under your control and you could have done better, and what was completely out of your control?
        \n• What are all the counterarguments to your underlying beliefs? Your past accomplishments, the things you do have, the praise you got, everything that proves the event is an exception.
        \n• What’s the worst thing that could realistically happen and how bad would that be?
        \n• What difference will this one-time event make in a month, a year or a decade?
        \n• Are you sure that you are completely powerless in the situation? To reduce feelings of powerlessness, list all the moves you can make to get yourself in a better position.
        \n• Is thinking this way helping the situation or making it worse?
        \n• What is the most positive interpretation of the event you can think of?
        \n\n<b>Effect</b>
        \n\nDevelop an accurate view of the situation with a healthier narrative that follows it. Write down your new thoughts, feelings and action plan to put forth your desired lifestyle with this narrative.
        \n\nCognitive reframing needs to be used on a regular basis to be helpful. Some methods to help you stick with it are as follows:
        \n\n<b>Elastic Band Technique</b>
        \n\nWear a rubber band on your wrist and snap it lightly when you recognize yourself having a negative thought.
        \n\n<b>Watch Your Words</b>
        \n\nThe language you use helps inform your reality. If you constantly say you hate your job when you just dislike it, and if you call yourself an incompetent fool when you simply made a mistake, you\'re amplifying the intensity of the situation and making yourself needlessly miserable.
        \n\n<b>Look For Positives</b>
        \n\nWhether you feel positively or negatively is frequently just a matter of perception. When negative thoughts crop up, counter with positive thoughts to ensure the brain isn\'t strengthening its negative thinking patterns too frequently.

    <string name="emotionalAccountingOverview">Emotional Accounting involves identifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, interpreting and auditing your thoughts. After doing this, you then talk back to the negative voice in a systematic, structured, and analytical way. Thus you need to recognize when negative thoughts crop up and what type of cognitive distortion they fall under. By doing this, you can develop a realistic self-evaluation system to tackle the situation. Create a table with six columns with the labels below:
        \n\n• Event or situation
        \n• Toxic thought going through your head (ie, automatic thoughts and self-criticism)
        \n• Type of negative feeling it is causing and the intensity of it (ie, associated emotions)
        \n• Categorization of the toxic thought (ie, what cognitive distortion does it fall under)
        \n• <i>Performing a rational response to the toxic thought</i> (self-defense)
        \n• New intensity of the negative feeling (outcome)
        \n\nAfter this exercise, you should feel a lot better about the current situation you\'re in. As you gain more proficiency with using this technique, use thought-stopping techniques and interrupt negative thoughts as they start to snowball/spiral out of control.
        \n\nAnother similar technique to try is emotional downregulation, seen in this chart <a href="https://i.redd.it/k3t965t4ybu21.jpg">here</a>.

    <string name="facingFearsOverview">Nobody likes to think about the things that scare them, but one of the greatest regrets that people have when they die is that they didn\'t have the courage to pursue the dreams they had, and instead lived a life that others expected them to live. The main emotion that keeps people stuck with these regrets is fear, and learning how to tackle your worst fears can help you lead the life you want to live. Some steps to tackle these fears are below:
        \n\n<b>Just Do It</b>
        \n\nTo get confident about your abilities, do things repeatedly and the confidence will follow. That means you need to fake it until you make it - going up against your fear will get easier the more that you do it.
        \n\n<b>Develop A Persona To Follow</b>
        \n\nStart off by following a structure/role that comes from within you. Take on the posture of the role you want to replicate and maintain a confident disposition. The scaffolding holding up the role in your head can slowly fall by the wayside with more practice
        \n\n<b>Create A Fear List</b>
        \n\nDevelop a list of things that utterly terrify you, and via exposure therapy, tackle the fears on that list one by one. It is recommended to start small and tackle the least intimidating fears first to help you build up an authentic self. To successfully cross things off your fear list:
        \n• Give targeted estimates of the things you want to do by using <a href="http://topachievement.com/smart.html">SMART goals</a>, and remember that the anticipation will be worse than actual attempt (which causes a worry mismatch in your head).
        \n• Let go of the safety behaviors you have developed to protect yourself from feeling anxiety - they may lead to unintended effects that others pick up on. (For example, staying distant from others at a party due to social anxiety may have people label you as aloof and uninterested in social engagement, when that is not the case!) It may feel like it internally, but there is no terrifying secret that will be exposed that makes you worse than others; you just need to be authentically yourself.

    <string name="fiveWhysOverview">This exercise requires continually asking the follow up question <i>why?</i> when you notice a problem going on. Eventually, after asking why enough, the root of the problem will be found and then the solution to the problem can be formulated accordingly. The method is described below:
        \n\n• Write down very specifically what your problem is
        \n• List everyone affected and how they’re related to your problem (an example includes labeling people involved as either supportive or unsupportive)
        \n• Gather all the relevant data that explains the current problem
        \n• Start asking yourself <i>why</i> at least five times, and find one or more root causes to your problem
        \n• Find a proportionate solution for every <i>why</i> asked above
        \n• Prepare a plan for getting rid of the root cause
        \n• Communicate constructively with other affected people on how you will eliminate the root cause

    <string name="visualizingOverview">Visualization is a powerful tool to help one change their habits and achieve success. It has been used by athletes to help them believe in their mind\'s eye that they are already a winner and worthy, but it can also be used for those less athletically inclined as well. Before visualizing, make sure to turn off distractions (ie, phone) and practice deep breathing exercises to help yourself relax. Then, the steps to successfully visualize success are as follows:
        \n\n<b>What\'s the Goal You Want to Achieve?</b>
        \n\nIt\'s best to start small when setting goals, and focus on your five senses and how they feel upon thinking of your goal.
        \n\n<b>Picture the Scene of the Goal</b>
        \n\nImagine how you would feel in the situation right before achieving your goal. What are your thoughts? What are you doing to prepare? Imagine taking deep breaths while in this setting.
        \n\n<b>Think About the Goal and Scene Regularly</b>
        \n\nPractice makes perfect. Don\'t just visualize on the day you want to achieve your goal. Make sure to visualize often to strengthen the positive mindset associated with the goal.
        \n\n<b>Add More Positivity to the Visualization</b>
        \n\nCouple the visualizations with positive affirmations that work for you to further encourage a feeling of success with the goal.

    <!--DBT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="distressToleranceOverview"><b>Use Self-Soothing Thoughts</b>
        \n\nThere are three types of self-soothing thoughts that can help strengthen one\'s ability to tolerate distress:
        \n\n<i>Validation</i>
        \n\nValidating thoughts are ones that are openly acknowledging and accepting your experience precisely as it is in this moment. When you are truly validating toward yourself, you are directing understanding, empathy, and compassion toward whatever it is that you are experiencing. There is no judgment, labeling, or criticism of what you may be experiencing; simply pure understanding and acceptance. Example: “It’s okay that I am hurting right now and just want to feel better.” or “It’s understandable that I feel just as I do.”
        \n\n<i>Reassurance</i>
        \n\nWhen you adopt reassuring thoughts, you are actively reminding yourself that you are capable of tolerating the pain of this moment and that things are going to get better with time. You are remembering that no emotional pain lasts forever and that there have been times in the past when you have felt happy and at peace. Reassurance means acknowledging your pain while also reminding yourself that you can make it through to the other side. Example: “I can handle this pain, even though I don’t like it.” or “I know that pain is temporary… this will pass.”
        \n\n<i>Perspective Taking</i>
        \n\nPerspective taking means using your skills of mindfulness to step outside of complete fusion to your current experience and develop greater mindful awareness and observation. When you truly take perspective, you are looking at the big picture, rather than narrowing your attention in on the details or facts that you perceive as negative or threatening. Mindfully shift out of the thoughts that are fueling the emotional distress by reminding yourself that you have gotten through emotional pain and discomfort in the past. Put things in perspective by remembering that this is one moment in time out of many. Example: “I’ve felt this way before; I can handle this.” or “The bad feeling didn’t last forever in the past; it will pass this time too.”
        \n\n<b>A-C-C-E-P-T-S</b>
        \n\n<u>A</u>ctivity engagement helps distract
        \n\n<u>C</u>ontributing to external causes and getting involved with others
        \n\n<u>C</u>omparisons with others to remind how much we have to be grateful for
        \n\nopposite <u>E</u>motions are useful to help remember that emotions are temporary and can be changed with action
        \n\n<u>P</u>ushing away the current emotional state by visualizing yourself changing out of it
        \n\n<u>T</u>houghts and your cognitive abilities can give you a temporary reprieve from an intense emotional state
        \n\n<u>S</u>ensations for the five sensations can be effective temporary distractions from intense negative emotional states.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalRegulationOverview">DBT thinks about emotions as brief and voluntary body-wide responses to stimuli (both internal or external). The average emotion lasts for roughly 90 seconds, and emotional regulation is essentially the ability to control and influence the emotions that you have. This includes things such as when you have them, how you’re experiencing them, and how you’re expressing them to others.  <u>Note that controlling emotions is not synonymous with repressing them!</u>
        \n\n<b>Radical Acceptance</b>
        \n\nRadical Acceptance is accepting what is – exactly as it is. It is acknowledging both reality as it is right now and to the reality of the past. You may not approve of your past, but you do have to accept it. Resisting reality will not change it but just cause you to suffer further.
        \n\nPart of being human is experiencing pain. Some people\'s lives have more pain in them than others. But while pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional.
        \n\nPain + resistance = suffering
        \n\n<i>but</i>
        \n\nPain + radical acceptance = peace
        \n\nTo successfully practice radical acceptance, do the following things:
        \n• Notice when you are fighting reality
        \n• Turn your mind towards acceptance and stop resisting the previous reality
        \n• Relax your body
        \n• Act as if you\'re radically accepting, even if you currently aren\'t.
        \n\n<b>I-M-P-R-O-V-E</b>
        \n\nThis acronym is a nice mental mnemonic device that offers guidelines that can effectively improve the moment you are in.
        \n\n<u>I</u>magery will let you mentally transport yourself to a safe and soothing place.
        \n\n<u>M</u>eaning in your life will help create sound mental and emotional health

        \n\n<u>E</u>ncouragement will help keep motivation levels high and help maintain focus on our chosen goals.
        \n\nOther strategies that will help emotional regulation include:
        \n• Understanding your emotions
        \n• Feel your feelings
        \n• Use counterconditioning procedures
        \n• Increase positive experiences

    <!--EMDR Activity Overview-->

    <string name="affectScanOverview">The Affect Scan is a technique that will help you understand your negative cognitions in a clearer manner. Ask yourself the following questions:
        \n\n• When you think of the incident, what is the most disturbing aspect?
        \n\n• What image in the memory represents the worst part of the event? For instance, the way the person looked, or what they said, or when the person walked away. If no image clearly represents the incident, just think of the worst part.
        \n\n• When you hold the image/incident in mind, what emotions come up for you?
        \n\n• Where do you feel it in your body?
        \n\n• What negative thought goes along with it?
        \n\nNow hold together the image and the negative thought, and feel the physical sensations in your body. Focusing on the feelings let your mind scan back to your childhood and notice the earliest memory that pops up and comes to mind where you felt the same way.
        \n\n• On a distress scale from 0-10, how does the old memory feel now?
        \n\nIf you feel your body change for the worse, and/or the distress level is 3 or higher, the memory has probably not been fully processed. If so, pick a few words to be your cue to identify the childhood memory (for instance, lost in a mall, slapped at camp, ignored by parents, alone in the basement, caught stealing in class).
    </string>

    <string name="butterflyHugOverview">Cross your arms in front of you with your right hand on your left shoulder and your left hand on your right. Then you tap your hands alternately on each shoulder slowly four to six times. To try it, bring up the image of the safe or calm place along with that positive word that you’ve connected with it and allow yourself to go into that state of safety or calm. And when you have that sense, tap alternately on your thighs or with the Butterfly Hug four to six times, then stop and take a breath and see how it feels.
    </string>


    <string name="containerExerciseOverview">Bring some sort of secure container into your mind’s eye, either in this room or in another secure place. This container will be strong enough to hold your disturbing thoughts – the memories, images, thoughts, physical sensations, sounds, smells, and emotions.
        \n\nWhat would this container have to be like in order to securely hold your distress? For example, it could be a safe, office drawer, shipping container, crate, or something else. What is your container? Imagine its color, size, appearance, materials, and what exactly makes it secure.
        \n\nNow imagine taking the distressing thoughts and images and putting them inside the container and sealing it up. Be sure to put your container in a safe place where it cannot disturb you further. If any other thoughts come up in the meantime, imagine sending them to the container for the time being.
    </string>

    <string name="floatbackOverview">Bring to mind a negative cognition and recent event. Where do you feel it in your body?
        \n\nAs you think of the recent incident and the negative cognition, notice the feelings in your body, and let your mind float back to childhood. What memory comes to mind when you felt that way? If something automatically comes to mind, then write it down along with your age and how distressing you find it on a scale from 0 to 10. Using cue words, list the earliest memories and the ones with the highest distress level.
    </string>

    <string name="lightStreamOverview">The first part of the light stream technique is to be mindful of what you are experiencing and feeling in that moment. Ask yourself what emotions am I feeling right now, and where do I feel it in my body?
        \n\nThe second step is to imagine that those feelings are an object. The goal is to take the first thing that comes to mind after recognizing the emotions, and location. Mentally ask yourself these questions about the object:
        \n\n• “If it had a shape, what shape would it be?”
        \n• “If it had a size, what size would it be?”
        \n• “If it had a color, what color would it be?”
        \n• “If it had a temperature, what temperature would it be? Hot or cold?”
        \n• “If it had a texture, what texture would it be?”
        \n• “If it had a sound, what kind of sound would it make? High or low pitch?”
        \n\nNext, do a direct imagery exercise:
        \n\nPick a color that you most associate with healing. Imagine that there is a stream of light this color that is coming from the centre of the universe. This is a magic light, because the more you need of it, the more of it is available to you. Allow this light to flow into your head, and focus it down on the object. Let the light vibrate and resonate like a laser beam in and around this object. Allow yourself to just notice what happens to the object. Remember that the more light or energy that you need the more is available to you. Allow yourself to feel the light enter your mind, and allow the healing light again to vibrate and resonate in and around the object and notice what happens to the object.
        \n\nWhen you notice that the object is gone or feels that it is contained, allow yourself to let the energy from the light flow into your body. Allow it to reach the tips of your finger, and the tips of your toes. Allow yourself to be engulfed, and overwhelmed by the energy, count to three and open your eyes.
    </string>

    <string name="safePlaceOverview">Imagine a positive place that you have been in the past. It should give you a feeling of safety or a feeling of calm. Bring up an image of that scene, and notice the colors and any other sense experiences that may go with it. Notice the feel of it, and notice the sensations that come up in your body—your chest, stomach, shoulders or face. If positive feelings arise, now identify a single word that would go with this feeling.
        \n\nThen close your eyes again, and bring up the image, notice the pleasant feelings, and say the word in your mind. Just notice the feelings as you allow yourself to merge into the scene while you repeat the word in your mind. Then, pay attention your breathing and make sure the breaths you take are deep breaths from your stomach.
    </string>

    <string name="spiralOverview">Think of something that is mildly upsetting. Pick a distressing memory that is a 2 or 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is a neutral memory and 10 is as distressing as a memory could get. Think about the upsetting event.
        \n\nAs you think about it, ‘feel’ where the upset is appearing in the body. It may be in your chest, stomach, shoulders, back, or elsewhere. The feeling as it appears on the body level – the body sensation of the feeling of the upset is appearing somewhere. As you feel the body sensation underneath the feeling of upset, notice the ‘energy’ of the feeling and which way it is spinning. Clockwise or counter-clockwise, just notice which way the energy spins. Notice the spinning for awhile, and then ‘spin-the-feeling-in-the-other-direction.’ When you do that, notice what happens with the feeling.

    <string name="flashbackOverview">Flashbacks can be one of the most distressing aspects of trauma, as the reaction due to flashbacks can be surprising to not only yourself, but others. Some steps to take when you are in a flashback are as follows:
        \n\n• Say to yourself that you’re having an emotional flashback.
        \n\n• Remind yourself that you’re only afraid, but you aren’t really in danger.
        \n\n• Become aware of your right to have boundaries and that you don’t have to allow anyone to mistreat you in any way.
        \n\n• Tell your inner child that you love him/her unconditionally and undisputedly.
        \n\n• Remember that the flashback will pass and that it’s not eternal.
        \n\n• Remind yourself that you are in an adult body with skills and allies.
        \n\n• Ease back into your body, relax, breathe deeply and slowly, find a safe place, and feel fear without reacting to it.
        \n\n• Resist the inner critic with thought-stopping, thought-substitution and thought-correction.
        \n\n• Allow yourself to grieve.
        \n\n• Seek support and cultivate safe relationships.
        \n\n• Identify the trigger that caused the emotional flashback (people, places, activities, events, facial expressions etc.) and practice preventive maintenance.
        \n\n• Try to figure out what you’re flashing back too back to, see it as an opportunity to heal your wounds.
        \n\n• Be patient with the slow recovery process.

    <string name="traumaResolutionOverview">Sometimes it can be hard to recognize when we have resolved a trauma, whether it be through EMDR therapy or other methods. A list that can help you determine your progress is as follows:
        \n\n• Physiological symptoms of PTSD are within manageable limits
        \n\n• Able to bear feelings associated with traumatic memories
        \n\n• Authority over memories - can elect to both remember the trauma and to put it aside
        \n\n• Memory of the traumatic event is a coherent narrative linked with a feeling.
        \n\n• Damaged self-esteem has been restored
        \n\n• Important relationships have been re-established
        \n\n• Reconstructed a coherent belief system of meaning and belief that encompasses the trauma.

    <string name="grievingOverview">The best way to work through a lot of conflicting feeling is related to feeling our feelings and expressing them in a healthy manner. There are four main ways we can do this:
        \n\n<b>Angering</b>
        \n\nThis requires verbally complaining about your current and past losses. This also involves feeling the rage about all the intimidation, humiliation and neglect in the past. The key place to direct your anger is towards the figures that tormented you in the past.
        \n\n<b>Verbal ventilation</b>
        \n\nThis involves peaking or writing in a way that releases any painful feelings. Pain can be released through what we say, think or write. You can do that by writing a journal or speaking in an uncensored manner about whatever comes into your mind (free associations). You only have to be careful not to confuse verbal ventilation with fantasizing or excessive worrying. You don’t want to distract yourself from your pain; you want to be actively grieving.
        \n\n<b>Crying</b>
        \n\nThis is the counterpart of angering. When we are hurt, we feel sad and mad. So getting angry cannot be our only healing method; sometimes, crying is the only way to resolve an emotional flashback. The tears also stimulate the relaxation of the parasympathetic nervous system, so it can help you calm down and relax. If you are unable to cry, focusing on your breath usually helps you be better connected with your emotions.
        \n\n<b>Feeling</b>
        \n\nThis involves staying present in the internal emotional experience without any reacting. Feeling means surrendering to internal painful experiences without judging, resisting or emoting. It’s a kinesthetic experience, not a cognitive one, and it’s about getting out of your head and getting into your body. It’s about surrendering to the experience without resistance, and that can bring emotional release.

    <string name="sevenAsOverview">Discussed in Gabor Mate\'s book When the Body Says No, these were the seven A\'s that he recognized as being necessary for healing:
        \n\n<b>Acceptance</b>
        \n\nThis is the willingness to recognize the current situation one is in and accept how things are at the moment. To fully accept oneself, practice compassionate curiosity with oneself, hold oneself to realistic standards, and give oneself the same grace with difficult situations that would be given to others.
        \n\n<b>Awareness</b>
        \n\nThis requires being able to perceive emotional reality for what it is, and acknowledge what our gut feelings are telling us. Learning what the signs of stress are in one\'s body, which can be done by practicing mindfulness on a regular basis.
        \n\n<b>Anger</b>
        \n\nRepressing anger is profoundly unhealthy. Repression expresses itself as abnormal suppression and unregulated and exaggerated venting. However, acting out and yelling also isn\'t a healthy reaction to anger - it\'s rage masked as anxiety. Healthy anger helps one establish boundaries and doesn\'t cross other people\'s boundaries.
        \n\n<b>Autonomy</b>
        \n\nThe ability to assert oneself openly. If not allowed to do so resistance may show both physically and emotionally. Proper personal boundaries are at the heart of maintaining autonomy.
        \n\n<b>Attachment</b>
        \n\nThis represents our connection with the world. Seeking connections is a necessity for healing. One needs to be vulnerable enough to seek out support so that they feel validated in their experiences.
        \n\n<b>Assertion</b>
        \n\nBeing able to declare to people that we are who we are and act as we deem fit.
        \n\n<b>Affirmation</b>
        \n\nThis involves making a positive statement and moving towards something of value. It can be done by valuing our own creative selves and by valuing the connection we have in the world around ourselves. Health rests on the pillars of the body, the psyche, and spiritual connection.

    <!--Emotional First Aid Activity Overview-->

    <string name="failureAidOverview"><b>Obtain Support From Others</b>
        \n\nThe best way to grow from failure is to get support from others and have the positive lessons of the failure gently pointed out to you in the immediate aftermath of it. Just emotional support alone can validate misperceptions about oneself.  Lessons to take from failure include:
        \n\n• Failure is a great teacher
        \n• Failure provides new opportunities
        \n• Failure can make us stronger
        \n• Some failures are also successes
        \n• Failure makes future success more meaningful
        \n• Success is not always necessary
        \n\n<b>Regain Control</b>
        \n\nReexamine preparation and performance to that elements perceived as being out of control can be seen as such if approached differently. Exercise for this is as follows:
        \n• Define goal in realistic and specific terms
        \n• Break down the goal into intermediate steps
        \n• Set timeframes to the overall and intermediate goals.
        \n• List any potential detours, setbacks, or temptations and consider solutions to them.
        \n\nAnother exercise to feel more in control is as follows:
        \n\n• Describe the failure in question (focus on just one failure)
        \n• List all the factors that contributed to your failure
        \n• Identify which factors are in your control and which are not. Go through each factor and try to view it differently - try to replace one so that it is within your control.
        \n• Create a new list of action items that are within your control.
    </string>


    <string name="guiltOverview"><b>Give An Effective Apology</b>
        \n\nA proper apology includes the following things:
        \n\n• A statement of regret for what happened;
        \n• a clear “I’m sorry” statement;
        \n• a request for forgiveness—all of which must be delivered with sincerity;
        \n• validating the other person’s feelings, which is done by showcasing accuracy in conveying understanding of what happened back to the person, recognizing how they felt, acknowledging their feelings are reasonable, and conveying empathy and remorse for their emotional state;
        \n• offering atonement or financial compensation if applicable;
        \n• acknowledging we violated expectations to help assure it won\'t happen again
        \n\n<b>Forgive Yourself For Your Mistakes</b>
        \n\nIf you\'re not able to receive forgiveness from the person you wronged, don\'t let the guilt poison your every day life. Must recognize we\'ve beaten ourselves up enough and that excessive guilt serves no productive purpose going forward. Acknowledging the severity of the incident, the wrongdoings, and the impact on the person harmed both practically and emotionally. This process can be uncomfortable, if not outright painful to go through, but granting the self-forgiveness can free us in the long run. Some exercises for self-forgiveness include:
        \n\n<i>Accountability</i> for your role in the incident.
        \n\n• Describe the actions/inactions that led to the other person feeling harmed.
        \n• Then go through that description and take out any qualifiers/excuses from the explanation.
        \n• Summarize the harm the other person sustained both emotionally and tangibly. Go through the description of harm and makes sure it is as realistic and accurate as possible.
        \n• Then, consider the circumstances of the situation. Did you intend for the events to happen, and if not, what extenuating circumstances got in the way? The idea is not to excuse your actions but to understand where they came from so that you can forgive yourself.
        \n\n<i>Atonement</i>
        \n\n• Take action to minimize the likelihood of the incident occurring again.
        \n• Identify significant tasks, contributions, or commitments that would make forgiveness feel well-earned. Make a clear mark of when you\'ve earned your self-forgiveness so that you can literally close the book on your guilt for good.
        \n\n<b>Re-engage in Life</b>
        \n\nWhen dealing with survivor\'s guilt, focus on the people and obligations remaining and empower yourself to get through that way.  When dealing with separation guilt, write a paragraph describing how you are handling a relational dynamic and focus on how self-care and proper boundaries can make you a better person overall. If dealing with disloyalty guilt, write about how you have the right to live your life as you wish and don\'t need to uphold other\'s expectations in the process.
    </string>

    <string name="lonelinessOverview"><b>See Things More Realistically</b>
        \n\nThe first step to removing the negativity glasses that may be impeding your thinking is to fight pessimistic thinking by purposefully visualize scenarios of success that are both reasonable and realistic. It\'s helpful to also give benefit of the doubt by remembering that lonely people tend to assume the worst about how others feel about us. Instead, we must battle the internal tide of skepticism we feel and give the new people in our lives and the ones with whom we have existing relationships the benefit of the doubt. Lastly, taking action by doing the following exercise can help you identify avenues for social connection:
        \n\n• Go through your phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and social media contacts and make a list of people you consider friends or good acquaintances.
        \n• For each person, note when you last saw or communicated with him or her and create a master list of people you haven’t been in touch with for a while.
        \n• Prioritize your list by ranking all the people on it according to who in the past has made you feel best about being you. Your final ranking represents the order in which you should contact the people on your list. Reach out to at least one or two people a week and, when possible, initiate plans to meet.
        \n• Go to websites that list meetings or activities and scroll through their categories, such as Meetup. Even if you don’t find a specific meet-up that fits your interests, such sites are good places to get ideas for activities or hobbies that might intrigue you.
        \n• Identify at least three activities or topics you might want to pursue (e.g., book clubs, adult education classes, hiking or biking groups). Search online for meetings in your area.
        \n\n<b>Identify Self-Defeating Behaviors</b>
        \n\nTake time to reflect on how you might come across to your friends, colleagues, and loved ones or when you are on a date or any other type of social engagement. Try to identify at least three behaviors (including omissions, such as not conveying interest), even if they seem entirely justified and even if they seem relatively minor, that might be pushing other people away.
        \n\n• My self-defeating behaviors are: ____
        \n• Once you’ve identified what you might be doing incorrectly, be extremely mindful of avoiding such behaviors in the future. Keep your list handy and read it before you attend social engagements. Self-defeating mechanisms can be changed once you have identified them correctly but do not expect to eliminate them all at once.
        \n\n<b>Take Other Person\'s Perspective</b>
        \n\n<i>Failing to Engage Our Perspective-taking Muscles When We Should</i>
        \n\nTry to understand the other person\'s perspective - how they might see things, react to an action you take, or how their values and agenda may vary from your own.
        \n\n<i>Considering Only Your Perspective</i>
        \n\nBy not giving other people\'s perspective proper weight, it\'s far more likely to cause social strife in communication, whether it be in person or through electronic communications.
        \n\n<i>Only Consider Accurate Information</i>
        \n\nBe sure to consider accurate information as opposed to inaccurate information (such as broad stereotypes or gossip). Judge the person based on who they are and not preconceived notions.
        \n\n<b>Deepen Emotional Bonds With Others</b>
        \n\nThe best way to deepen emotional bonds is to practice empathy for others. These empathy muscles can be strengthened by visualizing yourself in the other person\'s shoes and knowing the context with which they might see a situation. Then, convey the insights you gained by showcasing your understanding in a compassionate and convincing manner.
        \n\n<b>Put Yourself Out There At Social Events</b>
        \n\nIf hesitant to attend new events, a way to circumvent that is to attend with another purpose in mind besides socializing. For example, one could attend a biking group if they were training for a triathlon. This way, the pressure isn\'t entirely put on socializing. Other avenues that can be used for meeting people include the Internet and volunteering.
        \n\n<b>Get A Pet</b>
        \n\nIf one is rural, lacks the mobility to get out into the community, or for other reasons has a hard time socializing on a regular basis, pets are a great way to help mitigate the feelings of loneliness. Just be aware that owning a pet (especially a dog) is a huge responsibility that should not be taken lightly, if that is the avenue one decides to take.
    </string>

    <string name="rejectionOverview"><b>Argue With Self-Criticism</b>
        \n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the but-rebuttal method mentioned in the CBT section. A general method can be followed:
        \n\n• List (in writing) any negative or self-critical thoughts you have about the rejection.
        \n• Use the following self-criticism “counterarguments” from a variety of rejection scenarios to formulate personalized rebuttals to each of the self-criticisms you listed. Feel free to list more than one counterargument per self-critical thought when it is relevant to do so.  Whenever you have a self-critical thought, make sure to immediately articulate the relevant counterargument(s) fully and clearly in your mind.
        \n\nFor example, a relevant argument for romantic rejection involves assuming that the pairing is just a bad fit, rather than related to any personal shortcomings. For workplace rejection, remember job hunting is generally an employee-unfriendly process where job rejection is inevitable, and when in a job, remember that rejection by colleagues may be related to the culture of the company or attempting to appeal to superiors. For social rejections, keep in mind that you may have outgrown the social group you were previously a part of, or may have different values that make it hard to be close with them.
        \n\n<b>Revive Self-Worth</b>
        \n\n• Make a written list of five characteristics, attributes, or traits you value highly that you have. Keep your list relevant to the area that the rejection occurred. It is important to take the time to think about qualities that really matter to you (for example, if you’ve been rejected by a romantic partner and you know the following qualities to be true you might list items such as caring, loyal, good listener, considerate, and emotionally available). Rank your list of characteristics according to their order of importance to you.
        \n\n• Choose two of the top three attributes you listed and write a short essay (one or two paragraphs) about each one, covering the following points:
        \n• Why the specific quality is important to you
        \n• How this attribute influences your life
        \n• Why this attribute is an important part of your self-image
        \n\n<b>Rebuild Feelings of Social Connection</b>
        \n\nEven though the pain of rejection may make us not want to engage with others, it is worthwhile to have a strong support system in place to help mitigate stressful events. Ways to replenish feelings of social connection are to find new affiliations with a better fit for the person you are currently, and to recall past positive experiences.
        \n\n<b>Desensitize Yourself</b>
        \n\nUse this technique only if you are in a good mental state! The more one is exposed to situations that are deemed uncomfortable or unpleasant, the less they end up disturbing us. For situations like asking people out on dates, calling prospective employers for jobs, applying to internships or other educational programs, or initiating new friendships, desensitization can be a great tool to work past fears of rejection in various realms.
    </string>

    <string name="ruminationOverview"><b>Change Perspective</b>
        \n\nRather than view things from a first-person point of view (which causes a narrative of the experience to replay), view the rumination-causing events in the third person to get a more realistic perspective on the situation.
        \n\nTo visualize the situation differently, imagine a snapshot of the situation that is causing rumination. Zoom out the scene slowly until you\'re a passerby in the situation who happens to see it, rather than a direct participant.
        \n\n<b>Distract Yourself From The Emotional Pain</b>
        \n\nRepressing the thought urges is an ineffective measure, however distraction is an effective mechanism for breaking a rumination spell. Some effective methods of distraction include video games, reading, socializing, and exercise. When time is short, spending a few minutes on a short puzzle or imagining the layout of a supermarket broke the train of rumination. The best method of distraction will vary depending on setting and the ruminative memory, so through trial and error figure out which method of distraction is appropriate for the current situation.  To identify potential distractions, list the places and situations where you ruminate most often, and with each place you ruminate, list as many short and long distractions as possible. Once the list is complete, carry it with you so that you can refer to it in times of rumination.
        \n\n<b>Reframe Anger</b>
        \n\nThe catharsis model of dealing with anger (ie, hitting things when angry) has been found to be counterproductive when coping with anger. The best way to deal with anger is to instead reframe it, which can be done by doing the following:  Find the positive intention in the situation that\'s causing anger
        \n• Identify opportunities for improvement
        \n• Embrace the learning moment
        \n• View the offender as needing help
        \n\n<b>Go Easy On Friends</b>
        \n\n• Ensure that balanced mutual emotional support provided
        \n• Do not ruminate same topic to them endlessly as they will expect you to move on past a certain point
        \n• Make sure that conversations are not constantly serious and have some light-hearted moments and fun included in them.
    </string>

    <string name="selfEsteemOverview"><b>Be Self-Compassionate</b>
        \n\nThe critical voice in one\'s head can be devastating to cope with. Being empathetic to our own experiences goes a lot further than criticizing ourselves to death. To learn more about self-compassion, check out Kristin Neff\'s <a href="https://self-compassion.org/">work</a>.
        \n\n<b>Know And Affirm Your Strengths</b>
        \n\nRather than use positive affirmations, which try to confirm qualities we\'d like to have but don\'t believe that we have, identify self-affirmations that identify valuable aspects of ourselves we know to be true and can\'t be taken away from us even if we fail. An exercise to follow to enforce this practice is as follows:
        \n\n• Grab two sheets of paper. On the first list your important attributes and qualities, including any achievements you deem significant. If negative thoughts crop up while coming up with positive achievements, write them on the second sheet of paper.
        \n• Choose one item from the first sheet that is especially meaningful to you and write a brief essay about why the achievement is meaningful. Then take the second sheet of paper, crumple it up, and throw it in the garbage. On following days, choose other items from your positive list of attributes and write about those as well.
        \n\nAnother method to identify your strengths is to fill out this  <a href="https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/questionnaires/survey-character-strengths">survey</a>, which will identify your top 5 strengths.
        \n\n<b>Accept Compliments</b>
        \n\nRejecting compliments will just make you feel worse about yourself. A writing exercise to become more accepting of compliments is as follows:
        \n\nThink back to a time when someone expressed appreciation for either a personal quality that you have or something that you did. Describe the incident and what made the person feel positively about you when it occurred.
        \n\n• What does displaying this attribute or behavior mean to you?
        \n• What benefits does having the attribute or behavior bring to your relationships and friendships?
        \n• What other significant or meaningful functions or roles can the attribute or behavior contribute to your life?
        \n\n<b>Be More Assertive</b>
        \n\nAssertive people have a lot of great traits that are worth replicating. They like themselves as they are, can have their needs met appropriately, express their feelings, and are not afraid to take initiative when the time comes. An exercise to identify areas to be more assertive are as follows:
        \n\n• Think about aspects of your life that make you frustrated. Include your social life, family life, work life, personal life, and community life.
        \n• Describe three examples from each of those domains. Rank your items according to which you have both a high likelihood of success and manageable consequences in case of failure.
        \n• After creating your list, do some strategic planning. Understand the mindsets of relevant people around and the structure of any bureaucracy you may need to approach.
        \n• Think through the plan of action and anticipate any reactions to the best of your ability.
        \n• Use practice, persistence, and patience to develop personal empowerment. As more successes develop, they will snowball and lead to increased overall self-esteem.
        \n\n<b>Improve Your Self-Control</b>
        \n\nWillpower is a finite resource; in order to maximize its effectiveness, we need to strengthen our basic willpower muscles, manage the energy reservoirs that fuel our self-control so they aren\'t depleted, and minimize the impact of the many temptations that exist around us. For example, to strengthen willpower, do the following on a schedule for 4-8 weeks:
        \n• Use non-dominant hand doing something
        \n• Stop slouching
        \n• Quit eating sweets - to best manage energy resources, keep your diet balanced so that the body doesn\'t experience sugar crashes.
        \n\nThe best way to preserve willpower, however, is to avoid temptations and to manage them when one is unable to. When one is unable to avoid temptations, do the following:
        \n\n• Play one side of the brain against the other - when feeling tempted to give into a craving or addiction, logically recall the reasons it would be bad to give back into that habit.
        \n• Minimize the damage - When slipping back into an old habit, treat it as a willpower muscle running out rather than as an excuse to start over entirely.
        \n• Avoiding Triggers - Many bad habits are prompted by triggers. (Ex, eating popcorn is associated with watching a movie.) Reading up on the Habits section in this app can help you understand more about how to build better habits overall.
        \n• Lastly, practicing mindfulness can help one understand when craving develop and learn how to tolerate the urges and impulses associated with them.

    <string name="traumaOverview"><b>Ease Immediate Emotional Pain</b>
        \n\nDepending on your personality, either talking about the traumatic experience or distancing yourself from the experience. Either way, time will help to heal all wounds.
        \n\n<b>Recover Lost Parts Of Yourself</b>
        \n\nWhen trauma occurs it is very easy to lose parts of oneself as certain people, places, or activities are associated with the trauma. An exercise to help recover these lost aspects is as follows (caution: only do this exercise if the trauma is still fresh and the distress you\'re feeling is extreme):
        \n\n• List qualities, characteristics, and abilities you value in yourself or others value in you before events occurred (write down at least 10 things).
        \n• Notice which ones have become less prominent since the trauma, and then write a paragraph describing why you feel disconnected from the specific attribute. And for each quality, write a paragraph describing possible people, outlets, or activities to pursue that would allow you to express the quality in a more substantial way than you are able to currently.
        \n• Rank the items and tackle the ones that are the most doable and emotionally manageable.
        \n\n<b>Try To Find Purpose In A Tragedy</b>
        \n\nThere are two phases to getting over tragedy, and these include sense making and benefit finding. Sense finding helps one to make sense of the tragedy, and involves asking why, not how when thinking about the tragedy. Making sense also involves asking what might have been (which is an incredibly painful exercise that should only be done once one is far along in recovery and believes in fate) and giving the actual outcome of the events more meaning as a result.
        \n\nBenefit finding requires considering the potential benefits of the loss, which can happen in later stages of recovery. An exercise to help identify benefits includes imagining yourself 10 years in the future. Imagine that you obtain something significant and are looking back on your life. Answer the following questions:
        \n\n• I never imagined back then that tragic events would lead to ___.
        \n• What I did was significant because ___.
        \n• The first step of my journey toward the achievement was when I ___.
        \n• My achievement was possible because I changed my priorities such that ___.
        \n• Changing my priorities led me to make the following changes in my life: ___.
        \n• Along the way I realized my purpose was to ___.

        \n\n• Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and do not break the chain.
        \n\n• Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.
        \n\n• Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior.
        \n\n• Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.

    <!--IFS Activity Overview-->

    <string name="earlyChildhoodTraumaOverview">Many people grow up thinking that they mistakenly grew up in a normal household, when in reality their family could be considered a low-nurturance family. Signs that one trusts their family is as follows:
        \n\n• As a child, you felt safe, appreciated, enjoyed, supported, respected (ie, loved) unconditionally.
        \n• As a child you trusted your caregiver to consistently and genuinely care about major needs, fears, and hurts and to help protect the child against these things.
        \n• Genuine praise, appreciation, and encouragement are spontaneously exchanged often amongst the family.
        \n• There were no major taboos or family secrets that can\'t be talked about in the family.
        \n• The family followed a healthy grieving policy for coping with life\'s disappointments and losses.
        \n• The family has a steady feeling of spontaneous teamwork and cooperation exists most of the time (as opposed to competition)
        \n• Family adults are committed to learning, teaching, and using effective thinking, communicating, and problem-solving skills within the family and outside of it.
        \n• Family members are not caught up in long-standing addictions and can be present for the children that are around them
        \n\nSo would you describe your upbringing as being high-nurturance? If not, don\'t fret - most people can\'t. However, by growing up in a low-nurturance household, it is possible that you have inherited psychological wounds that need to heal. So check out that section for more information. Another resource to refer to if you feel your childhood wasn\'t up to snuff is Jonice Webb\'s Running on Empty, which focuses on the issue of Childhood Emotional Neglect, where parents take care of a child\'s physical needs but completely ignore their emotional ones.

    <string name="partsWorkOverview">Once one has a list of personality subselves developed, the meat and potatoes of IFS therapy begins. Some common methods used in IFS are as follows:
        \n\n<b>Create a Parts-Work Journal</b>
        \n\nThis written outlet can be a place where subselves can vent and record their experiences and discoveries. If you don\'t have a lot of experience with journaling, some ways to write are as follows:
        \n\n<i>Freewriting</i>
        \n\nFreewriting involves writing about whatever comes to mind for 10-20 minutes. This type of writing is good for creativity and fostering a capacity to express yourself. You don\'t need to worry about exactly what is being written on the paper and the grammar/spelling - just go ahead and write.
        \n\n<i>Expressive Writing</i>
        \n\nExpressive writing is writing about a specific topic for 20-30 minutes (or until one feels like they have finished). Focus on the feelings of the topic and things you haven\'t openly acknowledged to others, even if they feel embarrassing to talk about. Some topics to write about include:
        \n\n• Traumatic experiences
        \n• Something you feel the need to disclose and/or confess
        \n• Stresses
        \n• A problem you want to solve
        \n\n<b>Choose an Inspiring Role Model</b>
        \n\nIdentify someone who appears to be well-balanced, healthy, confident in their own skin, nurturing, and productive in their every day lives. Have this person be someone you look up and aim to be like as you continue your work through parts therapy.
        \n\n<b>Informational Internal Interviews</b>
        \n\nThis is a popular method to get to know your parts better, as well as understand certain ones that are living in the past. Some questions you can ask these subselves include:
        \n\n• Appearance (if any)
        \n• Gender (if any)
        \n• Preferred title or name
        \n• What year they think it is
        \n• Main job, and what would happen if they stopped doing their job
        \n• Key beliefs
        \n• How they communicate (thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, hunches)
        \n• Frustrations and needs
        \n\nThe goal is to befriend these parts and gain their trust, especially the ones you have ignored for a long time. As you build more trust, ask it about its story and show compassion towards the experiences it has had.
        \n\n<b>Unblending</b>
        \n\nIt\'s important to know if your true self ends up being enmeshed with one of your part\'s emotions. If you cannot tell how you feel towards the target part right now, then you would be considered to be blended with that part. Some ways to unblend from the target parts include:
        \n\n• Ask the part to separate from you so you can learn more about it
        \n• Move back internally to separate from the part
        \n• See an image of the part at a distance from you, or draw the part on a piece of paper.
        \n• Do a short grounding meditation
        \n\nIf the part does not feel like it separates, ask it what it is afraid will happen if it does separate, and explain the value of separating to the part and reassure it about its fears.
        \n\n<b>Redoing</b>
        \n\nThis is a powerful parts work technique that involves a fair bit of planning and rehearsing to ease the pain of a traumatic event. The steps to follow it include:
        \n\n• Identify the specific young subselves that carry your worst pain, and learn as much as you can about them
        \n• Focus on a past real-life trauma that affects a young subself.
        \n• Build a (small) imaginary redo team, where adult subselves can lead the young subself through the sequence of events.
        \n• Be clear on why you\'re redoing the chosen memory and how you would have liked things to go.
        \n• Make sure you\'re in a safe place when you do the redoing and the subself is ready for the experience.
        \n• Take a few deep breaths and recall/replay the incident, aiming for the outcome that was decided on earlier. Don\'t rush the process; allow it to take as long as it needs to finish.
        \n• Return to the present moment and debrief on how things went. See how the previously traumatized subself feels now.
        \n\n<b>Rescuing</b>
        \n\nThis is a form of redoing, and is a key parts work technique aimed at getting highly distresssed subselves out of the traumatized situation they are still living in. The main way to do it involves:
        \n\n• Identifying the parts of yourself living in the past
        \n• Patiently gaining their trust
        \n• Preparing a safe, nurturing (inner) place for them to exist in the present
        \n• In a similar way to redoing, help them transfer safely out of their traumatic environment to join other subselves in the real present
        \n\nRescuing paralyzed or exiled parts can help thaw frozen grief, heal toxic old shame, and see the world as it really is. A symptom of a successful rescue is having life-long fears, anxieties, and frustrations permanently recede.
        \n\n<b>Retraining</b>
        \n\nA lot of the subselves in you probably hold faulty and unrealistic beliefs about yourself and the world around you. A major part of parts work is educating those parts of yourself and having them learn to understand things in a healthier manner. One of the hardest parts to retrain is the Inner Critic, and the main methods for helping to defuse the Inner Critic include:
        \n\n• Identify which changes you would like the Inner Critic to make
        \n• Learn what the Inner Critic is trying to do when it acts out
        \n• Teach the Inner Critic that acting as it does is unintentionally stressing out other parts of yourself, and that it should adopt things like using kinder language and not endlessly repeating input
        \n• Follow up to reinforce the positive changes for the Inner Critic
        \n• Allow renaming for the subself so it can adopt a new identity (this is also known as reassigning); for example, the Inner Critic can be changed to something like The Consultant once the intensity of the critic has dialed down significantly
        \n\n<b>Accepting Disowned Parts of Self</b>
        \n\nMost of us have parts of ourselves that we do not particularly enjoy. Some psychologists have theorized that we are most intensely repelled by and attracted to people that displays traits/parts that are similar to those that we are trying to disown. So we need to accept that we have a dark side, though we do not need to let these parts of ourselves strongly influence our decisions. A method to identify these parts include:
        \n\n• Identify which people in your life you have extreme negative feelings towards, and determine if there\'s a common pattern in the people you react strongly towards regarding personality traits and behaviors
        \n• For every trait you identify, go inside and invite any part that carries that trait to identify itself to you. If a part does not show itself to you, find your subselves that hold the strongest feelings of disgust and ask why they have such intense reactions to that specific trait.
        \n• After finding a rejected part, refresh your attitude and remember that any subself can shift its energy to new goals given enough encouragement over time.
        \n• Meet and learn more about this rejected part, befriending it along the way
        \n• Identify the subselves that want to reject the disowned subself. Learn why they do so without judgement, acknowledge their specific anxieties, and work patiently to help reduce them over time
        \n• Determine if the disowned subself is living in the past, and if so rescue it safely when the time seems right. Also attempt retraining once the disowned part feels more free to express itself
        \n\n<b>Develop a Spiritual Subself</b>
        \n\nThis does not apply to everyone, but a large percentage of people have a subself amongst their manager subselves that tries to connect them to a higher power. The way to free this is very similar to disowned subselves, but you can rely on this part to help out. Some things it can do are:
        \n\n• Offer guidance when one is feeling confused or conflicted
        \n• Can help comfort Inner Children
        \n• Can help out tired Guardians who are exhausted and need a break
        \n• Can be present at Inner Council Meetings that are held (described below)
        \n\n<b>Inner Council Meetings</b>
        \n\nWhen you need to make a major life decision, it\'s worth holding a meeting amongst all parts of yourself so that you make the best decision for your future. To successfully do this:
        \n\n• Hold your meeting in a safe place where every self feels like they can speak up.
        \n• Your true self leads the meeting and asks for input from the various parts it has decided should attend. This meeting stays on track and does not get derailed due to the self\'s leadership.
        \n• Make sure each subself can speak up respectfully and follow the rules so that every subself can speak up about their thoughts.
        \n• Ensure that clear decisions are reached through brainstorming, empathic listening, respectful assertion, and problem-solving skills.
        \n\nFor parts work to truly succeed, these steps will need to be taken over the course of years. There is no quick fix for resolving the trauma of your inner parts, though EMDR has been thought to help accelerate the healing that IFS works towards.

    <string name="personalitySubselvesOverview">Ever have an argument with yourself? Ever notice part of you wants to eat a sweet treat but another part is insisting that you shouldn\'t have it? These are your inner voices having a dialogue with each other, and these inner voices are known as personality subselves. The main way to heal from psychological wounds is to become familiar with one\'s subselves and understand what their needs and purpose are. This process is intentional and will likely take multiple years to fully complete, given there are many subselves that the average person has.
        \n\nSubselves can be categorized into three parts:
        \n\n<b>Managers</b>
        \n\nManagers are the main subselves that run the show when the rest of your parts feel safe and satisfied enough. A typical list of manager subselves can be seen  <a href="http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/managers.htm" target="_top">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Inner Kids</b>
        \n\nInner children are the developmentally young parts of oneself, which tend to be reactive and naive about the state of the current world. When unsupervised, these subselves can hurt yourself or others, so other subselves try to take care of them. A list of inner child subselves can be seen <a href="http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/kids.htm" target="_top">here</a>
        \n\n<b>Guardians</b>
        \n\nGuardians are the ever-watchful subset of our subselves that make sure that they don\'t step out of line. A list of Guardian subselves can be seen <a href="http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/guardians.htm" target="_top">here</a>
        \n\nTo heal from long-term psychological wounds it\'s essential to create a list of one\'s own personality subselves and understand how they affect one as a whole.
    </string>

    <string name="psychologicalWoundsOverview">Psychological wounds generally carry on between generations. This is, if your parents have a lot of psychological wounds, you may have inherited some of them as well, albeit unintentionally. Most people will rationalize, distract, and numb themselves from the psychic pain that they are feeling on a regular basis, and this can showcase in a variety of destructive manners (addiction, workaholism, etc). Common signs one has been psychologically wounded:
        \n\n• Excessive shame and guilt
        \n• Excessively fearful
        \n• Significant distortions of reality
        \n• Excessive trust or distrust
        \n• Difficulty feeling, empathizing, and bonding with other living things.
        \n\nTo be able to effectively heal one\'s wounds, according to IFS it\'s necessary to become connected one\'s various subselves, and how to do that is in the next section. However, the main tenets for recovery from psychological wounds are as follows:
        \n\n<i>Awareness</i>
        \n\nA common theme across these different therapies, it represents wanting to become habitually conscious of what one thinks, feels and needs in the moment over time.
        \n\n<i>Knowledge</i> about
        \n\n• early-childhood abandonment, neglect, and trauma
        \n• personality subselves and how to harmonize them
        \n• the basics of communication, grieving, and relationships
        \n\n<i>A stable motivation to change</i>
        \n\n<i>Healthy spiritual growth and faith</i>
        \n\n<i>Admission and subsequent desire to control any addictions</i>
        \n\n<i>Existence in a pro-recovery environment</i>
        \n\n<i>Curiosity about the process of healing</i>
    </string>

    <!--MBSR Activity Overview-->

    <string name="bodyScanOverview">The body scan is a powerful form of meditation that encourages you to be aware of how your body is feeling in the current moment. The general gist is that you end up giving devoted attention to each part of your body, starting from the base of your skull and going all the way down to your toes, while hitting everywhere in-between. The sensations in the body tend to be felt more acutely by giving them our full attention, but by doing so we also allow our body to process the feeling associated with the sensation too. Emotional reactions and thoughts will also inevitably appear while doing this exercise, but just be aware of these things popping up and instead to practice acceptance. Some body scan meditations (of varying lengths) are linked below:
        \n\n<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyKhfUdOEgs" target="_top">15 minute body scan </a></i>

    </string>

    <string name="breathingOverview">A basic method is to focus your attention on your own breathing—a practice simply called “mindful breathing.” After setting aside time to practice mindful breathing, you’ll find it easier to focus attention on your breath in your daily life—an important skill to help you deal with stress, anxiety, and negative emotions, cool yourself down when your temper flares, and sharpen your ability to concentrate. Some mindful breathing videos of varying lengths are provided below:

    <string name="lovingKindnessOverview">Loving-Kindness Meditations are a great way to harbor feelings of good will to others and to open up your heart. If you don\'t feel particularly compassionate, these meditations are also a way to build up that skill. Some general phrases you may say to yourself or others during a loving-kindness meditation include:
        \n• May you be happy.
        \n• May you be healthy.
        \n• May you be safe.
        \n• May you be loved.
        \n• May you be at peace.
        \n\nAs you build those feelings of goodwill to either yourself or others, you can extend it to include others up until you have included everyone on Earth within the bubble of loving-kindness. Some loving-kindness meditations are below:

    <string name="mindfulnessOverview">Below are some general acronyms and applications where one can use mindfuless to help change their innate reaction to situations that may occur on a daily basis.
        \n\n<b>S-T-O-P</b>
        \n\nStands for:
        \n• <u>S</u>top
        \n• <u>T</u>ake a moment
        \n• <u>O</u>bserve
        \n• <u>P</u>roceed
        \n\nWhen you\'re feeling overwhelmed, this acronym can help you to react in a healthier manner. For a more detailed description of the acronym, it suggests to stop what you\'re doing and put things down for a minute, take a few deep breaths, observe your current experience as is, and proceed with an activity that will better your well-being.
        \n\n<b>R-A-I-N</b>
        \n\nStands for:
        \n• <u>R</u>ecognize what\'s going on
        \n• <u>A</u>llow the situation to be there, as it is
        \n• <u>I</u>nvestigate with kindness
        \n• <u>N</u>on-identification with the experience
        \n\nWith these four steps, you first become aware of the situation, allow its existence without negative judgments, try to understand why it is happening without judging, and then refuse to identify with the experience or let it be a defining moment. By following this acronym on a regular basis, you will be free to become your true self.
        \n\n<b>Emotional Hunger</b>
        \n\nEmotional and physical hunger can feel identical if you haven\'t learned how to tell the two apart. Ways to tell the two apart:
        \n\nEmotional Hunger is sudden, generally is a craving for a certain food, is based in the mind and mouth, is urgent, is paired with an upsetting emotion, involves automatic or absent-minded eating, does not notice or stop eating in response to fullness, and feels guilty about eating.
        \n\nPhysical hunger is gradual, open to eating different foods, is based in the stomach, does not need to be satiated immediately, occurs out of physical need, involves deliberate choices and awareness of eating, stops eating when full, and realizes eating is necessary.
        \n\nAnother way to track your hunger is to use a hunger fullness scale, where 0 is where your stomach is entirely empty and 10 is where you\'re unbearably full. Generally, you want your hunger and fullness range to be from about a 3 to a 7 (moderately hungry to moderately full), as it\'s easier to ensure you don\'t hit the extreme ranges of hunger, which will make it much more likely to overeat and get stuffed. By having mindful awareness of one\'s hunger levels it\'s easier to maintain a diet and stay satiated throughout the day.
        \n\n<b>Pleasant / Unpleasant Events Diary</b>
        \n\nWrite notes after each day of particular events which you found pleasant or unpleasant, and ask the following questions:
        \n\n• Where were you when you had the positive experience?
        \n• Were you aware of the pleasant/unpleasant feelings at the time?
        \n• Did you notice any body sensations? What were the details of them?
        \n• What was your mood, thoughts, feelings at the time of the event?
        \n• What thoughts and feelings are with you as you write about the event?
        \n\n<b>Stressful Communications Diary</b>
        \n\nWhenever you have a difficult communication during the day, make a note of the following:
        \n• Who it was with and what the issue was
        \n• What were your expectations from the communication, and what was the outcome
        \n• What were the other person(s) expectations, and what did they get out of it?
        \n• What were your thoughts, feelings and body sensations at the time.
        \n• How did those affect your actions?
        \n• Have you resolved the situation? If so, how?
        \n\n<b>Looking At Ourselves Exercise</b>
        \n\n• Write down a list of the things that happen for you in a typical day.
        \n• Now write down next to each one the letter N if it is nourishing and D if it is depleting.
        \n• What do you notice?
        \n• Are you happy with it?
        \n• What might you do to change it?
    </string>

    <string name="traumaMindfulOverview">Mindfulness and meditation are definitely great resources to seek out. However, if one has experience with trauma, it\'s important to pay attention to these things so that mindfulness can be a positive experience for you.
        \n\n<b>Stay Within The Window Of Tolerance</b>
        \n\nThe window of tolerance is a region of stability between hyperarousal and hypoarousal. Hyperarousal represents increased emotional reactivity, hypervigilance, intrusive imagery, and increased sensation. Hypoarousal involves an absence of sensation, numbed emotions, and reduced physical movement. A main reason that surviors of trauma can struggle with mindfulness meditation is that they end up going into either hypo or hyperarousal when they try to meditate. To help stay within a window of tolerance, you can do the following:
        \n\n<i>Watch Out For Dysregulated Arousal</i>
        \n\nThere are a few signs that someone might be meditating outside of their personal window of tolerance:
        \n\n• Muscle tone either very rigid or very slack
        \n• Hyperventilating
        \n• Easily startled
        \n• Excessive sweating
        \n• Dissocation
        \n• Emotional volatility
        \n\n<i>Focus On Stabilization and Safety</i>
        \n\nCatharsis of emotion does not automatically mean that the processing of trauma is occurring. To heal from trauma, a person must first feel stabilized and safe lest they retraumatize themselves in the process of trying to heal.
        \n\n<i>Educate Others About Window Of Tolerance</i>
        \n\nWell-meaning mindfulness experts may insist that meditating despite symptoms of hyperarousal is a healing practice, but for survivors of trauma it can ultimately be destabilizing. Letting people know about this is the best way to make sure they can practice mindfulness in a healthy manner.
        \n\n<i>Use Mindful Gauges</i>
        \n\nA mindful gauge can be either related to body sensations, moods, feelings, or thoughts. Every person has a measure of how they are in the current environment, and becoming aware of those gauges is important to staying in your window of tolerance.
        \n\n<i>Learn When To Back Off</i>
        \n\nTrauma can be handled at a slow pace and does not need to be processed all at once. If meditation is causing some form of dysregulated arousal, some ways to back off include:
        \n\n• Keeping your eyes open during meditation
        \n• Taking structured breaks from mindfulness and possibly shorter sessions
        \n• Take a few deep breaths
        \n• Put your hand on your heart
        \n\n<i>Practice Grounding Techniques</i>
        \n\n• Breathing can be a great grounding technique. If you are feeling hyperaroused, taking deep breaths can help to calm you down, but if you are feeling hypoaroused, taking faster breaths can help to bring you energy and stability.
        \n• Other methods for grounding include practicing simple arithmetic tasks, change the current gravity of your body (ie, move your arms above your head or rise on your toes), and compare the different textures of items that are around you.
        \n\n<i>Check An Arousal Scale</i>
        \n\nConnect with your needs and develop a scale from 0 to 10 where you can track your arousal state. 0 represents hypoarousal, 5 represents in the window of tolerance, and 10 represents hyperarousal. Check in with yourself regularly to see where you lie on the scale and learn when you are within your own personal window of tolerance.
        \n\n<i>Stay Within Own Window of Tolerance</i>
        \n\nThe main way to stay within our own level of tolerance is to practice self-care techniques. These can include:
        \n\n• Monitoring our own arousal
        \n• Exercising
        \n• Eating healthy
        \n• Spending time in nature
        \n• Being around friends
        \n\n<b>Shift Attention To Support Stability</b>
        \n\nPeople who struggle with trauma will tend to reflexively orient themselves towards trauma-oriented stimuli, whether they be internal or external. Thus when someone with trauma meditates, they can end up over-focusing on the traumatic stimuli that are in front of them, and thus end up in a perpetuating cycle of misery. Some modifications that can be made to avoid this are:
        \n\n<i>Educating Others</i>
        \n\nKnowledge is power, and informing others that traumatized individuals have a tendency to hyperfocus on their trauma can help guide people to practice mindfulness in a healthier manner.
        \n\n<i>Create Stable Anchors of Attention</i>
        \n\nAn anchor of attention can be something we come back to when our mind wanders meditating. A lot of people use their breath as what to come back to, but for survivors of trauma this is not always a viable option. Experiment to see what sensations can be seen as stabilizing for you.
        \n\n<i>Reorient Attention</i>
        \n\nIf some sensation/meditation practice is causing distress, redirect your focus and try to focus on a stable feeling or body sensation in your body.
        \n\n<i>Attend To The Environment</i>
        \n\nA good way to stay in the present when meditating is to focus on your surroundings and remind yourself that in the present moment, you are indeed safe.
        \n\n<i>Focusing In Then Expanding Awareness</i>
        \n\nStart off focusing on one thing when meditating, and then slowly expand your awareness. If things begin to feel overwhelming, dial it back to focus just on that one thing.
        \n\n<i>Build Resilience</i>
        \n\nResilience is the ability to cope with adversity and stress, and can help us focus on that brings us joy rather than what has caused us to suffer in the past. You can practice guided meditations that focus on joy to help foster this feeling.
        \n\n<b>Pay Attention To The Body</b>
        \n\nThere are two main ways the body picks up on stress - exteroceptive and interoceptive sensations. Exteroceptive sensations are related to the five main senses, and interoceptive sensations are related to what\'s happening in our bodies. People struggling with trauma tend to place a lot more emphasis on interoceptive sensations than others would, and this can cause dissociative symptoms to show up. Being aware of when dissociation begins is integral to actually integrating traumatic experiences effectively.
        \n\n<i>Let People Be In Control</i>
        \n\nIf a command does not feel right to do during a meditation, go at a pace you think will be best and feel free to modify the process so that you can stay in your window of tolerance.
        \n\n<i>Incorporate Movement</i>
        \n\nIf being still and trying to meditate feels too overwhelming, try a walking meditation or some yoga exercises instead. They may be closer to what your body needs in the moment.
        \n\n<i>Watch for Dissociative Symptoms</i>
        \n\nIf you find yourself daydreaming, spacing out, losing track of time, acting differently, and/or experiencing rapid shifts in emotion, you may be dissociating. If this happens when you are trying to meditate, adjust your meditation ritual to something else that is less likely to cause dissociative symptoms.
        \n\n<i>Focus On The 5 Senses To Ground Yourself</i>
        \n\n• Touch - focus on a particular object someone can touch that they find soothing, or make contact with their own bodies (hands together, etc).
        \n• Taste - have a small candy or other food item that can be eaten when emotions feel distressing
        \n• Smell - use an essential oil to smell back into the present.
        \n• Hear - listen to the sounds around and have it be an anchor to the here and now.
        \n• See - notice objects in the environment and name them to ground in the present moment.
        \n\n<i>Flexibility With Posture</i>
        \n\nDoes a pose feel wrong to do sitting up? Be willing to adjust the position to lying down or standing, and to do so during a meditation.
        \n\n<b>Practice With Others</b>
        \n\nHealing from trauma alone is not a feasible strategy. Finding a community and people you can trust and rely on will help you be aware of your regulation abilities and foster a sense of connection to the world.
        \n\n<b>Understand Social Context</b>
        \n\nThis means being able to see and acknowledge that everyone has a unique history and trauma affects us all differently. Trauma can be affected by a person\'s age, gender, disability, religion, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, and culture. These need to be taken into account and acknowledged appropriately before delving into treatment, and are in general just good things to be aware of when fostering deeper connections with others.

    <!--Schema Activity Overview-->

    <string name="abandonmentOverview">A person with an Abandonment schema has a fear of losing those closest to them. They will:
        \n• Cling to friends
        \n• Experience jealousy and competitiveness
        \n• Refuse to engage in intimate relationships.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Realize that people won\'t leave your life on a whim
        \n• Internalize partners as stable objects, then you will be able to be on your own for an extended period of time and not feel the need to reach out and connect to someone immediately
        \n• Learn to keep relationships that are stable and productive rather than attempt to survive on ones that will flounder.
    </string>

    <string name="approvalSeekingSchemaOverview">A person with a Need for Approval schema has gotten deeply involved with and affected by the idea that love:
        \n\n• Needs to be won from other people
        \n• It is not something that they deserve or are entitled to automatically
        \n• Leaves a void that they cannot fill themselves
        \n\nNeed for Approval schemas often arise in childhood, when children feel that a parents or other important figures in their lives only show love or affection when the child is behaving a certain way. These people seek approval at the expense of expressing themselves authentically and fulfilling their core needs.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Focus on accomplishments as opposed to flaws
        \n• Tackle cognitive distortions that feed attention-seeking and spineless behavior
        \n• Develop the ability to be emotionally self-sufficient
    </string>

    <string name="defectivenessOverview">The feeling that one is defective, bad, unwanted, inferior, or invalid in important respects; or that one would be unlovable to significant others if exposed. May involve:
        \n\n• Hypersensitivity to criticism
        \n• Rejection and blame
        \n• Self-consciousness
        \n• Comparison and insecurity around others
        \n• A sense of shame regarding one\'s perceived flaws. These flaws may be private (e.g., selfishness, angry impulses, unacceptable sexual desires) or public (e.g., undesirable physical appearance, social awkwardness).
        \n\nOverall, the defectiveness schema is related closely to impostor syndrome.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Tackle the cognitive distortion of feeling inferior and defective.
        \n• Accept the possibility of either good or bad things happening and the parts of yourself you may dislike.
    </string>

    <string name="dependencyOverview">There are two main aspects to this schema:
        \n\n<i>Dependence</i>
        \n\n• Lacking faith in decisions and judgments about everyday life.
        \n• Hate/fear facing change alone
        \n• Unable to tackle tasks alone and need someone to show them what to do.
        \n\n<i>Incompetence</i>
        \n\n• Finding people to take care of them, or just not functioning at all whatsoever.
        \n• Waiting for someone else to show them the way.
        \n• Difficulty traveling alone, asking for advice.
        \n\nThere is a worrisome tradeoff with dependency that involves becoming counterdependent and doing everything on one\'s own. There needs to be a healthy balance between doing things independently and being able to rely on others for assistance.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Build confidence and skills by trying to do things alone - by doing so, will end up not relying on others to an unhealthy degree afterwards.
        \n• Learn to trust own intuition and judgments rather than relying on others.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalDeprivationOverview">People with an Emotional Deprivation schema feel they do not get enough affection, attention, or deep emotions expressed. They generally feel misunderstood and alone in the world. There is a deprivation of:
        \n• Nurturance (nobody is there to hold them, pay attention to them, or give physical affection)
        \n• Empathy (nobody is there who listens or understands who they are and how they feel),
        \n• Protection (nobody is there to protect/guide them, despite offering as much for others).
        \n\nPeople with this schema:
        \n\n• Express no desire for love or comfort
        \n• Focus on the other person while not talking about themselves
        \n• Act stronger than they actually are
        \n• Act as if they have no emotional needs, so their emotional needs are not fulfilled
        \n• Are attracted to partners who are either cold/aloof or needy/self-centered, so the relationship is draining. Either they stay in distant relationships or avoid them entirely.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Become aware of emotional needs, and accept that they are natural and right
        \n• Get needs for nurturance, empathy, and protection met
        \n• Choose appropriate people to open up to and ask for needs in appropriate ways
        \n• Be able to be both strong and vulnerable
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalInhibitionOverview">People with this schema are scared of discussing their emotions. This showcases as:
        \n• Restraint and outright suppression of emotions.
        \n• Fear of being vulnerable to others.
        \n• Valuing self-control above all else.
        \n\nIf someone authentically expresses emotions and is true to themselves, they will be afraid of abandonment and punishment. This can result in excessive dependence on rationality with disregard for their own emotional needs. People with this schema tend to be rigid to routine rather than spontaneous, and this schema can be the result of deep shame felt when expressing emotion as a child.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\nLearn to become emotionally expressive and more spontaneous.
        \n• Appropriately deal with anger, engage in leisure, express affection, and talk about feelings.
        \n• Predict how expressing emotions will go and note the results.
    </string>

    <string name="enmeshmentOverview">The Enmeshment schema involves excessive emotional involvement and closeness with one or more significant others at the expense of full individuation or normal social development. Signs of this include:
        \n\n• Feels they cannot survive or be happy without the support of others
        \n• Feels smothered/fused with others and lacks individual identity
        \n• Feels empty and lacks direction in life
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Must feel it\'s okay to become untangled from others and thrive on their own.
        \n• Must discover own preferences and identity through mindfulness and establishing boundaries.
    </string>


    <string name="entitlementOverview">Sometimes considered grandiosity and superiority. People with this schema feel like they are owed something for existing and act superior to others. The two main types of entitlement are:
        \n\n• Narcissistic entitlement, a compensation strategy for deep feelings of shame and inadequacy
        \n• Pure entitlement, where a child was allowed to do whatever they wanted without any recourse
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\nUse CBT principles to tackle the distortions and should statements inherent to feeling entitled (ie, feeling one should have money/comfort/etc). Relevant things to ask yourself include:
        \n\n• Who says I should?
        \n• Replace the should in your statement with would like to
    </string>

    <string name="failureSchemaOverview">This schema is focused around the belief that someone has failed, will inevitably fail, or is fundamentally inadequate relative to their peers in areas of achievement (school, career, sports, etc.). Often involves beliefs that they are stupid, inept, untalented, ignorant, lower in status, less successful than others, etc.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Face the fear of failure
        \n• Refute the idea that failure is inevitable
        \n• Recognize cognitive distortions in thoughts and think about failure in a less catastrophic manner
    </string>

    <string name="healthyBoundariesOverview">• You can say no or yes, and you are okay when others say no to you.
        \n• You have a strong sense of identity.
        \n• You respect yourself.
        \n• You expect reciprocity in a relationship - you share responsibility and power.
        \n• You know when the problem is yours and when it belongs to someone else.
        \n• You share personal information gradually in a mutually sharing/trusting relationship.
        \n• You don’t tolerate abuse or disrespect.
        \n• You know your own wants, needs and feelings.
        \n• You communicate them clearly in your relationships.
        \n• You are committed to and responsible for exploring and nurturing your full potential.
        \n• You are responsible for your own happiness and fulfillment.
        \n• You allow others to be responsible for their own happiness and fulfillment.
        \n• You value your opinions and feelings as much as others.
        \n• You know your limits.
        \n• You allow others to define their limits.
        \n• You are able to ask for help when you need it.
        \n• You don’t compromise your values or integrity to avoid rejection.
    </string>

    <string name="hypercriticalnessOverview">A Hypercriticalness schema has the underlying belief that someone must strive to meet very high internalized standards of behavior and performance, usually as a way to avoid criticism. Typically results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down. It also includes feelings of hypercriticalness toward oneself and others. There generally is significant impairment in pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, and/or satisfying relationships. Unrelenting standards typically present as:
        \n\n• Perfectionism, inordinate attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one\'s own performance is relative to the norm
        \n• Rigid rules and shoulds in many areas of life, including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts
        \n• A preoccupation with time and efficiency, so that more can be accomplished
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Make risks seem less scary to take
        \n• Pick up a hobby
        \n• Choose to do things imperfectly
        \n• Do a cost-benefit analysis on effort given to specific tasks
    </string>

    <string name="insufficientOverview">People with this schema have zero impulse control and have difficulty facing challenges. They are too focused on immediate gratification and thus are unable to pursue long-term goals. This schema is commonly related to the Subjugation schema.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Must recognize when schema is kicking in and act rationally.
        \n• Prioritize long-term goals and work towards them above all else.
    </string>

    <string name="mistrustOverview">Generally expect bad treatment from others. They tend to think or say that they always get the worst of things, that other people want to do them harm, or that it’s not safe to trust others. Having a Mistrust Schema means feeling deep down, on a gut level, regardless of logic, that other people cannot be trusted, that the only safety is in keeping others at a distance. The Mistrust Schema generally is built early in life in response to abuse, whether emotional, physical, or sexual, by a person in authority or by anyone who is deeply trusted. A child who is mistreated will often naturally adopt a strategy of assuming the worst of other people in order not to be put in a vulnerable position again if it can be helped.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n• Must consciously trust others
        \n• Must notice how being so distrustful shuts one off from opportunities in life.
        \n• Must resist fortune-telling and assuming what other people think of them.
    </string>

    <string name="negativityOverview">People with this schema typically amplify the negative things in their life to the expense of the positive ones. They have a fear of making a critical life-ruining mistake and thus live in constant anxiety. People with this schema are chronically tense, regularly complain, and are generally indecisive. This schema typically compensates for the Emotional Deprivation schema.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Try not to prepare constantly for the worst case scenario
        \n• Take a slightly more optimistic than realistic take on things
        \n• Try to not ruminate obsessively on future scenarios and grilling yourself for past mistakes
        \n• Ask people to meet emotional needs in relationships rather than take maladaptive strategies to have needs met
        \n• Schedule time designated for worrying
        \n• Remember negative events in the past do not inform events occurring in the future
    </string>

    <string name="punitivenessOverview">Related to the Unrelenting Standards and Defectiveness schema. Involves punishing yourself for not living up to impossible standards or for being broken/bad. This means you are unable to forgive yourself and others for mistakes and believe that they deserve punishment. This schema can be self-directed or directed at others.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Question person\'s intentions first before deciding on either doing punishment or forgiveness.
        \n• Work on practicing self-forgiveness and then extend it to others in a similar way.
        \n• Do not let taking responsibility for one\'s actions derail attempts of forgiveness.
    </string>

    <string name="schemaEmotionsOverview"><i>Identifying and Awareness of Emotions/Feelings</i>
        \n\n• What feelings/sensations do I have?
        \n• Where in my body am I feeling it? in my chest? throat? stomach?

    <string name="schemaCopingModesOverview">This discussion of child and adult modes is very similar to things discussed in IFS, so if you find this section relevant I encourage you to check out more in that section.
        \n\n<b>Child Modes</b>
        \n\n<b>Maladaptive Coping Modes</b>
        \n\nThe vulnerable child feels lonely, isolated, sad, misunderstood, unsupported, defective, deprived, overwhelmed, incompetent, doubts self, needy, helpless, hopeless, frightened, anxious, worried, victimized, worthless, unloved, unlovable, lost, directionless, fragile, weak, defeated, oppressed, powerless, left out, excluded, pessimistic
        \n\n<b>Maladaptive Parental Modes</b>
        \n\nThe angry child feels intensely angry, enraged, infuriated, frustrated, impatient because the core emotional (or physical) needs of the vulnerable child are not being met
        \n\n<i>Vulnerable Child</i>
        \n\nThe impulsive child acts on non-core desires or impulses in a selfish or uncontrolled manner to get his or her own way and often has difficulty delaying short-term gratification; often feels intensely angry, enraged, infuriated, frustrated, impatient when these non-core desires or impulses cannot be met.
        \n\n<i>Angry Child</i>
        \n\nThe contented child feels loved, contented, connected, satisfied, fulfilled, protected, accepted, praised, worthwhile, nurtured, guided, understood, validated, self-confident, competent, appropriately autonomous or self-reliant, safe, resilient, strong, in control, adaptable, included, optimistic, spontaneous.
        \n\n<i>Impulsive Child</i>
        \n\n<i>Contented Child</i>
        \n\nIf someone has adapted this coping mode, they have decided to avoid conflict at all costs. Some signs of this coping mode include:
        \n\n• Appearing passive and dependent
        \n• Feeling helpless in face of what\'s ahead
        \n• Being obedient to the point of allowing abuse
        \n\n<i>Compliant Surrenderer</i>
        \n\nShut down from others in order to protect themselves from pain of being vulnerable. May feel numb or empty, and act aloof or cynical to avoid being invested in people or other activities. Behaviors include:
        \n• Social withdrawal
        \n• Excessive self-reliance
        \n• Addictive self-soothing
        \n• Fantasizing
        \n• Compulsive distraction
        \n• Stimulation seeking
        \n• Psychological Withdrawal
        \n\n<i>Detached / Avoidant Protector</i>
        \n\nAct as if the opposite of the schema were true, when one is being impacted. Try to maintain strict order, self-control, or immense predictability through planning and routine. Behaviors include:
        \n\n• Aggression and hostility
        \n• Status-seeking
        \n• Passive-aggressiveness and rebellion
        \n• Excessive orderliness
        \n• Dominance and self-assertion
        \n\n<i>Overcompensator</i>
        \n\n<i>Guilt-Inducing Parent Mode</i>
        \n\nThis voice will make you feel bad for almost anything that you do in day-to-day life, but especially with regards to setting boundaries. Some common refrains from this mode include:
        \n\n• I can\'t put myself first as others will suffer
        \n• If I can\'t help others, I\'m lazy and selfish
        \n• I\'m self-centered if I say no
        \n• I can\'t disappoint others
        \n\nThis is a mode that can be developed over time and can be formed through either direct or indirect requests to caretake for someone else.
        \n\n<i>Demanding Parent Mode</i>
        \n\nThis voice represents the inner perfectionist and is the ultimate fear-driven adult mode. It will catastrophize your situation if you do one simple thing wrong so you are stuck with the worst fate imaginable. People with these behaviors will generally be obsessive with their work and have an inner critic that never shuts up about anything.
        \n\n<i>Punitive Parent Mode</i>
        \n\nThis voice is nasty and tells you that you are worthless, useless, and defective. It tends to replicate voices of abuse that you have heard in the past, or is born because you did not have positive messages about being valued, loved, and seen growing up. To actually develop self-worth we need to be cared for in a way that makes us feel emotionally understood and validated. Signs of a punitive parent mode include:
        \n\n• Belief that they do not deserve good things
        \n• Extreme self-loathing
        \n• Feeling that they deserve punishment
        \n\nUsually the louder this voice is, the more likely the individual suffers from recurrent depression.
        \n\n<i>Healthy Adult Mode</i>
        \n\nTo heal all of these voices, the best method is to develop a strong Healthy Adult mode. This mode does the following:
        \n\n• Nurtures, validates and affirms the vulnerable child mode
        \n• Sets limits for the angry and impulsive child modes
        \n• Promotes and supports the healthy child mode
        \n• Combats and eventually replaces the maladaptive coping modes
        \n• Neutralizes or moderates the maladaptive parent modes
        \n\nThis mode also performs appropriate adult functions such as working, parenting, taking responsibility, and committing to tasks. It pursues pleasurable adult activities such as sex, intellectual/aesthetic/cultural interests, health maintenance, and athletic activities.
    </string>

    <string name="schemaTreatmentOverview"><b>Identify Alternative Schemas</b>
        \n\nAsk questions such as:
        \n\n• How would you like things to be?
        \n• How would you like yourself, others or the world to be?
        \n• If people weren’t ___, how would you like them to be?
        \n\n<b>Limited Reparenting</b>
        \n\nProvide experiences through therapy that were missed in early childhood through empathic confrontation. This is done by reaching out to the Vulnerable Child Mode within you in a reassuring manner, while setting limits on what the Avoidant and Compensatory modes can do in the meantime. A therapist doing limited reparenting will also provide constructive outlets for the Angry Child Mode to let out its frustrations.
        \n\n<b>Guided Imagery</b>
        \n\nBring up upsetting childhood memories in form of images, emotional expression and grieving are encouraged. Identify need that weren\'t met and how maladaptive schemas were formed, connect to current situation that is triggering current maladaptive schema.
        \n\n<b>Positive Data Log and Schema Diary</b>
        \n\nKeep daily log of observations that are consistent with new adaptive schema, and how what person learns during therapy is applied until next therapy session.
        \n\n<b>Flash Cards</b>
        \n\nCreate written statements that help access healthy sides of self and internalize/enforce healthy schema formation.
        \n\n<b>Continuum Methods</b>
        \n\nSchemas represent absolute thinking. Some ways to track the nature of the thinking include:
        \n\n• Adaptive Continuum (see on scale from 0 to 100 where thinking is on a continuum)
        \n• Criteria Continua (break down personality characteristic into several subcriteria and see where you fall in that)
        \n• Two Dimensional Charting of Continua (when concepts are connected, chart a predicted graph and find exceptions to rule)
        \n\n<b>Psychodrama, Role-Playing, and Chair Work</b>
        \n\nPsychodrama involves remembering the early childhood scene that caused the schema to form and activate. You can then re-experience the event with roleplaying the scenario, where you can protect yourself with your adult voice. If that approach does not work, you can use a method called chair work. It requires two chairs that face one another, where one side is the schema and the other is a healthy outlook. A dialogue between both sides ensues.
        \n\n<b>Historical Test of Schema</b>
        \n\nMake two separate lists, one for confirming and one for disconfirming evidence for the existence of various schema for different age periods.
    </string>

    <string name="selfSacrificeOverview">This particular schema involves putting other people\'s needs above your own, and repressing your own needs such that you are not relying on others. This schema leads to feeling resentful, unappreciated, and undervalued.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Put one\'s own needs above others
        \n• Enforce strict boundaries to maintain self-care strategies
        \n• Learn how to say no and to also accept help from others
    </string>

    <string name="socialIsolationOverview">This schema involves feeling like you do not belong anywhere. It brings about feelings of loneliness and a lack of security/safety in society.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Need to tackle negative thoughts holding one back, especially mind reading cognitive distortions
        \n• Must accept you won\'t belong in every social group, but you will be able to find a place to belong
    </string>

    <string name="subjugationOverview">People with this schema feel an overpowering obligation to submit to another person’s will, to be told what to do and be judged by someone else. Often such a person will believe in their heart that they need to do what another person says in order to be loved, valuable, etc., and/or will be afraid that they will be judged harshly or punished if they don’t fall in line. Having the Subjugation schema means burying or ignoring one’s own needs, desires, inclinations, judgments, and beliefs internally so they are not expressed. Whether this is happening due to giving in to others or to being preoccupied with rebelling against others does not matter, as in both cases the person with the Subjugation schema is reacting to others’ needs, desires, and actions instead of their own.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\n• Learn to be more assertive and communicative about boundaries
        \n• Practice mindfulness to be more aware of one\'s own thoughts/emotions
        \n• Take down cognitive distortions feeding into related behavior
    </string>

    <string name="vulnerabilityOverview">A Vulnerability to Harm and Illness schema\'s core is that there is a fear of a catastrophe that will overwhelm one\'s life. Thus, one must be overly vigilant in attempting to prevent that fear from occurring. This schema generally is common with anxiety disorders, and is common with people that had parents growing up that were fearful themselves and very over-protective.
        \n\n<b>Treatment</b>
        \n\nTo heal, you must accept the idea that harm may occur, even if the odds are small, and actively reject an obsession with said harm.
