# mental-health-guidebook

 This app was something I developed in 2019 to give myself a tool on my phone that offered up various techniques for managing mental health. It was developed using Android Studio and programmed in Java. A link to download the app on the Google Play Store can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amanda.mentalhealthguide).
 
 **Warning - this was my first attempt at coding a large-scale project like this, and I did this alone without any project management experience. Do not expect to see elegantly commented code if you dig into this; I prioritized functionality above all else.** 
 
 *(Let's just say I learned lessons about the importance of commenting and version control after doing this project.)*
 
 ## Getting Started
  
 ### Prerequisites 
 
 To use this code, download Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Installing

  Upon running the .exe file you will be prompted to set up Android Studio, where more installations will take place. Choose standard settings and allow to install. Once finished, click import existing Android Studio Project, and after cloning or downloading this repository, point Windows Explorer to where you downloaded/cloned the file.

### Deployment

 `"Your Download Location"\mental-health-guidebook\app\src\main\java\com\example\mentalhealthguide` is your main source of Java files for this project. The most recent files were the ones used in my final version of the app. The Java files with Overview in the name are for Fragments (Buttons are indicated generally in these files) and the other files represent Activities. 
 
 `"Your Download Location"\mental-health-guidebook\app\src\main\res\layout` has the activity files, fragment files, and other necessary Android files needed to make the app run.
 
  There are a lot of old versions of files in this for version control - generally look at the versions for 12/2019 if you want the most up to date and guaranteed functional files.
 
  *Note*: I have commented out the capacity for the app to produce ads. This functionality is in activity_main. If you want to add in ads be sure to change the app id around so that you are compliant with [Google standards](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads).
