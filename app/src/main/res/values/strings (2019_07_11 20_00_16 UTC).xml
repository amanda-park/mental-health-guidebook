    <!--Fragment Overview-->

    <string name="actOverview">Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT, typically pronounced as the word act) is a form of counseling and a branch of clinical behavior analysis. It is an empirically-based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility.</string>

    <string name="cbtOverview">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method of therapy that focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors that might affect someone. By recognizing the distorted thoughts and developing healthy coping mechanisms that target solving current problems, one will begin to experience relief from symptoms. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its use has been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.</string>

    <string name="dbtOverview">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a variation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy developed to treat Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT emphasizes the psychosocial aspects of treatment. The main components of DBT include a support-oriented environment, cognitive-based treatment, and a collaborative approach in what are usually weekly group treatments and weekly individual treatments. The four main modules are mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, and emotional regulation.</string>

    <string name="emdrOverview">Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is an integrative psychotherapy approach that has been extensively researched and proven effective for the treatment of various types of psychological and physical trauma that one has experienced in their lives. Through the use of bilateral stimulation (similar to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep), trauma that is stored in the body can be reprocessed so that healing can occur. The bilaterial stimulation can be achieved through eye movements, buzzers in each hand, or tapping on the body. Some mental exercises that can be used to prepare yourself for EMDR therapy are below:</string>

    <string name="emotionalFirstAidOverview">Emotional first aid is best used when treating a minor emotional trouble, that if left untreated, can fester into a more serious mental concern. Some of the troubles that qualify for these are the following:</string>

    <string name="habitsOverview">Habits are an automatic repetition of behavior. They can be healthy when they are for good behavior and detrimental when they enforce negative actions. The best way to reevaluate and enforce better habits can be seen in the algorithm  which covers the main four habit-building steps in order:</string>

    <string name="ifsOverview">Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a therapy that identifies and addresses the many sub-personalities (or families) within each person\'s mental system. These sub-personalities consist of wounded parts and painful emotions such as anger and shame, and parts that try to control and protect the person from the pain of the wounded parts. The sub-personalities are often in conflict with each other and with one\'s core Self, a concept that describes the confident, compassionate, whole person that is at the core of every individual. IFS focuses on healing the wounded parts and restoring mental balance and harmony by changing the dynamics that create discord among the sub-personalities and the Self.</string>

    <string name="mbsrOverview">Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an eight-week course that focuses on introducing mindfulness practices and yoga exercises into one\'s everyday life. While it is not specifically a therapeutic technique, following the protocol has been shown to ease a lot of mental health problems and lead to a higher quality of life overall.</string>

    <string name="schemaOverview">Schema therapy is an integrative psychotherapy combining theory and techniques from previously existing therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoanalytic object relations theory, attachment theory, and Gestalt therapy. The goal is to identify maladaptive schemas (ie, thought patterns) in childhood that led to unhealthy coping mechanisms as an adult, and to overwrite them to meet one\'s emotional needs that are likely being neglected.</string>

    <string name="schemaOverview2">The 18 main schema are listed above. Below are general treatment strategies used when undergoing schema therapy:</string>

    <!--ACT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="actConnectionExercisesOverview">1) Connection With The Environment
        \n\nSet your phone down for a second and become aware of your surroundings. Notice as much as you can about what you can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. What’s the temperature? Is the air moving or still? What is the lighting like? Count at least five sounds you can hear, five objects you can see and five things you can feel that are currently against your body (such as how your shirt feels, the air on your face, your feet on the floor, your back against the chair, etc). Notice what happens.
        \n\n2) Awareness Of The Body
        \n\nRight now, connect with your body. Notice where your legs and arms are and the position of your spine. Inwardly scan your body from head to toe; notice what you can feel in your head, chest, arms, abdomen, legs. Put your phone down, close your eyes and do this for 30 seconds. Notice what happens.
        \n\n3) Awareness Of The Breath
        \n\nConnect with your breathing. Notice the rise and fall of your rib cage and the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Follow the air in through your nose. Notice how your lungs expand. Feel your abdomen push outward. Follow the air back out, as the lungs deflate. Set aside any distractions, close your eyes and do this for 30 seconds. Notice what happens.
        \n\n4) Awareness Of Sounds
        \n\nIn this exercise, just focus on the sounds you can hear. Notice the sounds coming from you (from your breath and your movements), the sounds coming from the room and the sounds coming from outside the room. Close your eyes and do this for 30 seconds. Notice what happens.
        \n\n5) Notice Five Things
        \n\nThis exercise helps to center yourself and connect with your environment. Practise it a few times every day, especially whenever you find yourself getting caught up in your thoughts and feelings. You’ll find that it brings you back to the here and now. The steps include:
        \n\n1. Pause for a moment.
        \n2. Look around and notice five objects you can see.
        \n3. Listen carefully and notice five sounds you can hear.
        \n4. Notice five things you can physically feel.
        \n\nYou can develop this skill further by going for a daily walk and spending the whole time noticing what you can see, hear, smell and physically feel (and refocusing whenever you realise you’ve been ‘disconnected’).
        \n\n6) Connecting With Your Morning Routine
        \n\nPick an activity that’s part of your daily morning routine, such as brushing your teeth, combing your hair or taking a shower. Totally focus on what you are doing, using all your five senses. For example, when you’re in the shower notice the different sounds of the water: as it sprays out of the nozzle, as it hits your body, as it gurgles down the drain. Notice the temperature of the water and the feel of it in your hair. Notice the sensations of the water running down your back and legs. Notice the smell of the soap and the shampoo and how they feel against your skin. Notice the visual patterns of the water on the walls or curtain. Notice the clouds of steam billowing upward. Notice the movements of your arms as you scrub or shampoo. When thoughts and feelings arise, acknowledge them, let them be and refocus on the shower. As soon as you realise that your attention has wandered off, thank your mind and refocus on the shower. For starters, practise connecting with one part of your morning routine each day. Then, as your ability improves, extend it to other parts.
    </string>

    <string name="cognitiveDefusionOverview">Defusion will not necessarily make the thoughts go away and make you feel better. Must accept thoughts and not try to control/repress them. But some strategies that can be used to defuse thoughts are the following:
        \n\n<b>I’m Having the Thought That</b>
        \n\nTo begin this exercise, first bring to mind an upsetting thought that takes the form ‘I am X’, for example, ‘I am dumb’, ‘I am such a loser’ or ‘I’m so incompetent.’ Preferably pick a thought that often recurs and that usually bothers or upsets you when it does. Now hold that thought in your mind and believe it as much as you can. Focus on it for several seconds. Notice how it affects you.
        \n\n<b>Musical Thinking</b>
        \n\nBring to mind a negative self-judgement that commonly bothers you when it comes up, for example, ‘I’m such an idiot.’ Now hold that thought in your mind and really believe it as much as you can for about ten seconds. Notice how it affects you. Now imagine taking that same thought and singing it to yourself to the tune of ‘Happy Birthday’. Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens. Now go back to the thought in its original form. Once again, hold it in your mind and believe it as much as you can, for about ten seconds. Notice how it affects you. Now imagine taking that thought and singing it to the tune of ‘Jingle Bells’. Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens.
        \n\n<b>Naming Stories</b>
        \n\nIdentify your mind’s favourite stories, then give them names, such as the ‘loser!’ story, or the ‘my life sucks!’ story, or the ‘I can’t do it!’ story. Often there will be several variations on a theme. For example, the ‘nobody likes me’ story may show up as ‘I’m boring’, the ‘I’m undesirable’ story as ‘I’m fat’, and the ‘I’m inadequate’ story as ‘I’m stupid’. When your stories show up, acknowledge them by name. For example, you could say to yourself, ‘Ah yes. I recognise this. That old favourite, the “I’m a failure” story.’ Or ‘Aha! Here comes the “I can’t cope” story.’ Once you’ve acknowledged a story, that’s it—just let it be. You don’t have to challenge it or push it away, nor do you have to give it much attention. Simply let it come and go as it pleases, while you channel your energy into doing something you value.
        \n\n<b>Thank Mind</b>
        \n\nThis is a simple and effective defusion technique. When your mind starts coming up with those same old stories, simply thank it. You could say to yourself (silently) things like, ‘Thank you, Mind! How very informative!’ or ‘Thanks for sharing!’ or ‘Is that right? How fascinating!’ or simply, ‘Thanks, Mind!’ When thanking your mind, don’t do it sarcastically or aggressively. Do it with warmth and humour, and with a genuine appreciation for the amazing ability of your mind to produce a never-ending stream of thoughts.
        \n\n<b>Silly Voices Technique</b>
        \n\nThis technique is particularly good with recurrent negative self-judgements. Find a thought that upsets or bothers you. Focus on the thought for ten seconds, believing it as much as possible. Notice how it affects you. Then pick an animated cartoon character with a humorous voice, such as Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Shrek or Homer Simpson. Now bring the troubling thought to mind, but ‘hear’ it in the cartoon character’s voice, as if that character were speaking your thoughts out loud. Notice what happens.
        \n\nNow get the negative thought back in its original form, and again believe it as much as possible. Notice how it affects you. Next pick a different cartoon character or a character from a movie or television show. Consider fantasy characters such as Darth Vader, Yoda, Gollum or someone from your favourite sitcom, or actors with distinctive voices, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger or Eddie Murphy. Once again bring the distressing thought to mind and ‘hear’ it in that voice. Notice what happens.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalPhasesOverview">1) A Significant Event
        \n\nAn emotion is triggered by some sort of significant event. This event may happen inside your body (a distressing memory, a painful sensation or a disturbing thought) or it may happen in the world around you (something you can see, hear, smell, taste or touch). Your brain notices this event and alerts you that it\’s important.
        \n\n2) Get Ready For Action
        \n\nThe brain starts to evaluate this event: ‘Is it good or bad? Beneficial or harmful?’ At the same time, the brain starts to arouse the body for action: either to approach or to avoid the event. In this phase there is no distinctive ‘feeling’ in the usual sense of the word. If the brain judges the event as harmful, the ‘fight-or-flight response’ is triggered, and our body prepares to either attack or escape. If the brain judges the event as potentially helpful, our body prepares to approach and explore it. And as our body gets ready for action, we experience a variety of sensations and urges.
        \n\n3) The Mind Gets Involved
        \n\nIn the third phase, our mind starts attaching words, ideas and meanings to the changes happening in our body. For example, the mind may give our sensations and urges a label such as ‘frustration’ or ‘joy’, or ‘feeling lousy’. And what our mind tells us about these sensations has a significant impact on how we relate to them. For example, imagine two people on a rollercoaster. One of them is terrified; the other is exhilarated. Both are experiencing the same physical changes (raised adrenaline levels, increased blood pressure), the same physical sensations (churning stomach, pounding heart), and the same urges (to scream), but their subjective experiences are very different, depending on what their minds tell them. One mind says, ‘This is fun!’, the other mind says, ‘This is dangerous!’ Guess who feels exhilarated and who feels frightened. In the same way, one performer’s ‘stage fright’ can be another performer’s ‘adrenaline rush’. Both performers experience the same sensations (racing heart, shaking legs and so on), but their minds interpret those sensations very differently.
    </string>

    <string name="tvScreenOverview">Bring an unpleasant image to mind and notice how it’s affecting you. Now imagine there’s a small television screen across the room from you. Place your image on the television screen. Play around with the image: flip it upside down; turn it on its side; spin it around and around; stre-e-e-etch it sideways. If it’s a moving ‘video clip’, play it in slow motion. Then play it backwards in slow motion. Then play it forwards at double speed; then reverse it at double speed. Turn the colour down, so it’s all in black-and-white. Turn the colour and brightness up until it’s ridiculously lurid (so the people have bright orange skin and the clouds are hot pink). The idea is not to get rid of this image but to see it for what it is: a harmless picture. You may need to do this for anything from ten seconds to two minutes, until you really defuse it. If at the end of two minutes it’s still bothering you, then try the next technique.
        \n\nSilly Subtitles or Voiceovers
        \n\nKeeping that image on the television screen, add a humorous subtitle or voice-over to it, such as ‘The Ultimate Disaster! premieres on Channel 4, Friday, 7.30pm’ or ‘Now showing at a movie theatre near you: I Got Rejected By My Lover!’ If this image is linked to a story that you’ve already named, then use that name on the subtitle or voice-over. For example, an image of you failing might be subtitled: ‘The “Failure” Story’. If it’s still bothering you at the end of another 30 seconds, try the next technique.
        \n\nMusical Soundtrack
        \n\nKeeping that image on the television screen, add a musical soundtrack of your choice. Experiment with a few different soundtracks: jazz, hip-hop, classical, rock or your favourite movie themes. If the image is still bothering you, try the next technique.
        \n\nShifting Locations
        \n\nVisualise this image in a variety of different locations. Stay with each scenario for twenty seconds before shifting to a new one. Visualise your image on the T-shirt of a jogger or a rock star. Visualise it painted on a canvas, or on a banner, flying behind an aeroplane. Visualise it as a bumper sticker, as a magazine photo, or as a tattoo on someone’s back. Visualise it as a ‘pop-up’ on a computer screen or as a poster in a teenager’s bedroom. Visualise it as the image on a postage stamp or as a drawing in a comic book. Use your imagination with this; the sky’s the limit. As a final technique, you can do the following:
        \n\nChanging Genres
        \n\nThis is most useful with moving images. First convert the image into a short ‘video clip’, then visualise it on a television screen. Now try playing that ‘clip’ in different film genres. For example, imagine it as a gangster movie, a Western, a trashy soap opera, a sci-fi thriller, a Disney cartoon or a musical. Each time you switch genres, change the clothes, sets and acting styles, but don’t try to alter what actually happens. Keep the basic story exactly the same. Play it over and over in different genres until you can truly see that this is just a moving picture and nothing more.

    <!--CBT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="approvalAddictionOverview">Remember that your worth cannot be determined based on whether you are approved by others or not. It needs to come from within.
        \n\n1) Run Cost-Benefit Analysis on whether it\'s worth keeping spinelessness/approval addiction behavior
        \n\n2) Rewrite Silent Assumptions so they are more realistic and self-enhancing
        \n\n3) Self-Respect Blueprint - Write essay regarding why it\'s unnecessary to live in fear of disapproval or criticism, without falling into cognitive distortions
        \n\n4) Verbal Techniques - Disarming, vulnerability, etc
        \n\n5) Rejection is Not Your Fault! For example, romantic rejection is simply just not fitting other person\'s preferences. Don\'t sell self short, express genuine compliments to others, show interest in other people and their desires.
        \n\n6) Recovering from Rejection - give yourself a specific time to feel miserable about the situation, but do not endlessly ruminate. When thoughts come up otherwise, find distortions and do your best to mentally move on from the situation.
    </string>

    <string name="cognitiveDistortionOverview"><b>All-or-nothing thinking:</b> You see your situation as black and white, you want to have everything or nothing. Everything is unreachable perfection, and consequently you feel like you have nothing. But that’s far from the truth.
        \n\n<b>Overgeneralization:</b> You generalize one bad event that happened to you (rejection, for example) as a never-ending pattern that you can’t do anything about.
        \n\n<b>Mental filter:</b> You see only negatives and minuses and ignore all the benefits and pluses.
        \n\n<b>Discounting the positives:</b> You give zero value to your past accomplishments, strengths and positive qualities. They don’t count, because everyone has them.
        \n\n<b>Jumping to conclusions, Mind reading, and Catastrophizing:</b> You predict that things will turn out badly, even if you don’t have any proof for that, or you assume people will react negatively or reject you, again without any proof. Catastrophizing is jumping to negative conclusions on steroids.
        \n\n<b>Magnification or minimization:</b> You make a big deal out of small, not really important details, or you shrink things that are important to almost nothing.
        \n\n<b>Emotional reasoning:</b> You draw the conclusion that how you temporarily feel is who you really are. For example: “I feel like I didn\’t write this well enough, so I must really be a bad writer”.
        \n\n<b>“Should statements”:</b> You criticize yourself and others based on what you or they should, must, or have to do. You moralize to others and yourself.
        \n\n<b>Labeling:</b> You put a negative label on your identity based on perceived shortcomings, even if they’re not real. “I’m a complete loser”, would be a nice example.
        \n\n<b>Blame and personalization:</b> You blame yourself for things that were not your responsibility or you blame others for things that were your responsibility. Or you assume that no matter what other people do, they do it to block you or harm you personally. You also constantly compare yourself to others.
        \n\n<b>Always be right:</b> Being wrong is simply unthinkable to you. You try to prove that every one of your actions or thoughts is correct. You try to persuade others to think the same way you do.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of fairness:</b> You feel resentful or envious, because you think you know better what would be a fairer situation, than other people do.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of change:</b> You expect other people to change or the world to change more to your liking and wants. And your happiness seems to depend on that kind of change.
        \n\n<b>Fallacy of being a good person:</b> You expect being a good person and sacrificing for others will pay off somehow and when it doesn\’t you feel bitter.
        \n\n<b>Hindsight thinking and what-ifs:</b> You look back at your past decisions and make judgments how you could handle things better. But you handled it according to your knowledge and experience at that time. In the same way, you might constantly ask yourself “what if” about your future, but you’re never satisfied with the answer.
        \n\n<b>Control error:</b> You either see yourself as a helpless being with no personal power or control. Consequently, you feel stuck and externally controlled. The other extreme is if you feel responsible for everything and want to control everything.
        \n\n<b>Unrealistic comparison:</b> You compare yourself with other people, viewing them better as you are, not considering different starting points, life circumstances, genetic advantages, random luck events etc.

    <string name="antiProcrastinationOverview">1) Daily Activity Schedule
        \n\nWhen you are feeling disorganized and are not sure what to be working on, plan out every hour of the day with a schedule similar to the one seen <a href="https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/schedule-behavioral-activation.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n2) Anti-Procrastination Sheet
        \n\nIf the tasks you are doing feel unrewarding, write down why they seem so and put those predictions to the test when you are doing said tasks. The goal is to take a task, break it down into little steps, try to predict how difficult and satisfactory each part of the task will be, and then check in to see how difficult and satisfying the task was in reality. An example sheet can be seen <a href="http://www.stlouiscounselingandwellness.com/Handouts/Anti_Procrastination_Sheet.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n3) Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts
        \n\nIf you are paralyzed by the urge to do nothing, write down why you feel urge to do nothing (or whatever other automatic thoughts occur) and realize that motivation follows action and not vice versa. A sheet detailing this approach can be seen <a href="https://deploymentpsych.org/system/files/member_resource/Daily%20Record%20of%20Dysfunctional%20Thoughts-1.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n4) Pleasure-Predicting Sheet
        \n\nWhen you are not feeling like doing things alone, predict the enjoyment you will gain from doing the activity beforehand, then do it and see how you feel after doing it. Also see how being alone or with others impacts the activity. A sheet showing this in practice can be seen <a href="https://deploymentpsych.org/system/files/member_resource/Pleasure%20Predicting%20Sheet.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n5) But-Rebuttal Method
        \n\nWhen you find yourself giving yourselves excuses for not doing a task, combat those buts with logical and realistic rebuttals until you can feel comfortable actually doing the task and not question your capability about doing so. A sheet showing how to do so can be seen <a href="http://www.elizakingsford.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/But-Rebuttal-Method.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n6) Self-Endorsement Method
        \n\nWhen you\'re feeling like what you do isn\'t worth much, write down the self-downing thoughts and find the distorted patterns in them, while also listing accomplishments you have accrued each day. An example of such can be seen <a href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/learn-to-endorse-yourself/">here</a>
        \n\n7) TIC-TOC Technique
        \n\nWhen a task is thought about in a self-defeating manner, instead, think about the things that need to be done in a task-oriented way rather than a task-interfering way. An example sheet can be seen <a href="https://classroommentalhealth.org/exercises/materials/tic-toc-technique.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n8) Breaking Tasks Down into Small, Actionable Steps
        \n\nThis is a good strategy for when you are feeling overwhelmed by everything that has to be done during the day. A simple sheet how to break tasks down can be seen <a href="http://www.callistomedia.com/externaldocuments/cbt/CBT_Breaking_Down_Tasks2.pdf">here</a>
        \n\n9) Motivation Without Coercion
        \n\nDo you feel forced to do a lot of the tasks that are in your life? If you are feeling guilty and duty bound, eliminate the <i>shoulds</i> one might throw out when giving yourself instructions, and try to find the joy in the task in terms of what you want to do, rather than what you must do. To find out more, look <a href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/coercion-is-a-deadly-enemy-of-motivation/">here</a>
        \n\n10) Disarming Technique
        \n\nIf you are feeling like you are being pressured into something by someone else and are resentful about it, assertively agree with their opinion and tell them you are capable of doing it on your own. This will help you to unconsciously procrastinate the task. To learn more to resist getting pushed around and this technique, check <a href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/disarming-technique/">here</a>
        \n\n11) Can\'t Lose System
        \n\nWhen you are fearing failure and that is the root cause of your procrastination, write down any negative consequences of said failure and adopt a healthy coping strategy ahead of time by recognizing the cognitive distortions in your thoughts and replacing them with a realistic perspective on the situation.
    </string>

    <string name="cantOverview">When you are feeling incapable of something due to negative cognitions, set up an experiment and try to prove the can\'ts you believe in. If the can\'t you believe in is a particularly broad statement, try to break it down into smaller things you do not believe you are capable of and test those one by one.
    </string>

    <string name="countWhatCountsOverview">When you are lacking confidence or are feeling incapable of doing stuff on your own, count the number of times you can do things on your own. By quantifying your positive actions with a counter app on your phone (or a manual wrist counter), you can see and value your own positive contributions you have made in your life. This will also help reduce dwelling on inadequacies, whether they be perceived or real, and help build confidence in the abilities you currently do possess.
    </string>

    <string name="cognitiveReframingOverview">The main tactic to remember when trying to change your view on a situation is to use the ABC-DE acronym.
        \n\nAccurate Description of Event -write one down and keep it as free of as many cognitive distortions as possible.
        \n\nBeliefs Regarding Event - Describe seeing situation as accurately as possible. (What caused the situation to happen? What does the event say about you? What do you think should happen?)
        \n\nConsequences of Event - (What were the automatic negative thoughts, what were the feelings about the event, what were automatic actions taken in response to the situation)
        \n\n<i>*Cognitive Reframing starts here*</i>
        \n\nDispute - Challenge thoughts and beliefs to see reality more accurately. Questions to ask: If the same thing happened to your best friend or someone you love, what would be your interpretation of the event then? How would [enter the name of your role model] interpret this situation? What are other potential explanations besides blaming yourself? What was under your control and you could have done better, and what was completely out of your control? What are all the counterarguments to your underlying beliefs? Your past accomplishments, the things you do have, the praise you got, everything that proves the event is an exception. What’s the worst thing that could realistically happen and how bad would that be? What difference will this one-time event make in a month, a year or a decade? Are you sure that you are completely powerless in the situation? List all the moves you can make to get yourself in a better position. Is thinking this way helping the situation or making it worse? What is the most positive interpretation of the event you can think of?

    <string name="emotionalAccountingOverview">Emotional Accounting involves identifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, interpreting and auditing your thoughts. After doing this you then talk back to the negative voice in a systematic, structured, and analytical way. Thus you need to recognize negative thoughts, and when they crop up, note what type of cognitive distortion they fall under. This will allow you to develop realistic self-evaluation system to tackle the situation. Create a table with six columns with the labels below:
        \n\n1) Event or situation
        \n2) Toxic thought going through your head (ie, automatic thoughts and self-criticism)
        \n3) Type of negative feeling it is causing and the intensity of it (ie, associated emotions)
        \n4) Categorization of the toxic thought (ie, what cognitive distortion does it fall under)
        \n5) <b>Performing a rational response to the toxic thought</b> (self-defense)
        \n6) New intensity of the negative feeling (outcome)
        \n\nAfter this exercise, you should feel a lot better about the current situation you\'re in. As you gain more proficiency with using this technique, use thought stopping techniques (ie, setting boundaries against any anti-self process) and interrupt negative thoughts as they start to snowball/spiral out of control.

    <string name="facingFearsOverview">1) Do things repeatedly and the confidence will follow. That means you need to fake it until you make it - going up against your fear will get easier the more that you do it.
        \n\n2) Start off by following a structure/role that comes from within. Take on the posture of the role you want to replicate and maintain a confident disposition. The scaffolding holding up the role in your head can slowly fall by the wayside with more practice
        \n\n3) Create a fear list of things that terrify you, and via exposure therapy do the things that scare you. However, start small and tackle the least intimidating fears first to help you build up an authentic you. To successfully cross things off your fear list:
        \na) Give targeted estimates of the things you want to do (use SMART goals) and tackle them so that the rejection/fears can get tackled in a healthy way. The anticipation will be worse than actual attempt, which causes a worry mismatch.
        \nb) Let go of the safety behaviors you have developed to protect yourself from feeling anxiety - they may lead to unintended effects that others pick up on. There is no terrifying secret that will be exposed to make you worse than others; you just need to be authentic.

    <string name="visualizingOverview">Visualization is a powerful tool to help one change their habits and achieve success. It has been used by athletes to help them believe in their mind\'s eye that they are already a winner and worthy, but it can also be used for those less athletically inclined as well. Before visualizing, make sure to turn off distractions (ie, phone) and practice deep breathing exercises to help yourself relax. Then, the steps to successfully visualize success are as follows:
        \n\n1) First, you must consider the goal you want to achieve. It\'s best to start small when setting goals, and focus on your five senses and how they feel upon thinking of your goal.
        \n\n2) Picture the Scene of the Goal - Imagine how you would feel in the situation right before achieving your goal. What are your thoughts? What are you doing to prepare? Imagine taking deep breaths in this setting.
        \n\n3) Think About The Goal and Scene Frequently - don\'t just visualize on the day you want to achieve your goal. Make sure to visualize regularly to strengthen the positive mindset associated with the goal.
        \n\n4) Add More Positivity to the Visualization - Couple the visualizations with positive affirmations to further encourage a feeling of success with the goal.

    <!--DBT Activity Overview-->

    <string name="distressToleranceOverview">There are three types of self-soothing thoughts that can help strengthen one\'s ability to tolerate distress:
        \n\n1) Validation
        \n\nValidating thoughts are ones that are openly acknowledging and accepting your experience precisely as it is in this moment. When you are truly validating toward yourself, you are directing understanding, empathy, and compassion toward whatever it is that you are experiencing. There is no judgment, labeling, or criticism of what you may be experiencing; simply pure understanding and acceptance. Example: “It’s okay that I am hurting right now and just want to feel better.” or “It’s understandable that I feel just as I do.”
        \n\n2) Reassurance
        \n\nWhen you adopt reassuring thoughts, you are actively reminding yourself that you are capable of tolerating the pain of this moment and that things are going to get better with time. You are remembering that no emotional pain lasts forever and that there have been times in the past when you have felt happy and at peace. Reassurance means acknowledging your pain while also reminding yourself that you can make it through to the other side. Example: “I can handle this pain, even though I don’t like it.” or “I know that pain is temporary… this will pass.”
        \n\n3) Perspective Taking
        \n\nPerspective taking means using your skills of mindfulness to step outside of complete fusion to your current experience and develop greater mindful awareness and observation. When you truly take perspective, you are looking at the big picture, rather than narrowing your attention in on the details or facts that you perceive as negative or threatening. Mindfully shift out of the thoughts that are fueling the emotional distress by reminding yourself that you have gotten through emotional pain and discomfort in the past. Put things in perspective by remembering that this is one moment in time out of many. Example: “I’ve felt this way before; I can handle this.” or “The bad feeling didn’t last forever in the past; it will pass this time too.”

    <string name="emotionalRegulationOverview">DBT thinks about emotions as brief and voluntary full system responses to stimuli, either internal or external. The average emotion lasts for 90 seconds, and emotion regulation is essentially the ability to control and influence the emotions that you have, including when you have them, how you’re experiencing them, and how you’re expressing them.
        \n\n1) Radical Acceptance
        \n\nRadical Acceptance is accepting what is – exactly as it is. It is saying yes to both reality as it is right now and to the reality of the past. Note radical acceptance does not equal approval of one\'s past. You do not have to like reality, but you do have to accept it. Resisting reality does not alter it but merely ups your emotional suffering. Part of being human is experiencing pain. Some people\'s lives have more pain in them than others. But while pain is unavoidable, suffering is optional.  Pain + resistance = suffering but Pain + radical acceptance = peace  To successfully practice radical acceptance, do the following things:
        \na) Notice when you are fighting reality
        \nb) Turn your mind towards acceptance and stop resisting the previous reality
        \nc) Relax your body
        \nd) Act as if you\'re radically accepting, even if you currently aren\'t.
        \n\n2) IMPROVE

        \n\nImagery will let you mentally transport yourself to a safe and soothing place.
        \n\nMeaning in your life will help create sound mental and emotional health
        \n\nPrayer (or mindfulness) will help you be aware of your presence in the world.
        \n\nRelaxation has the benefit of reducing body tension that is often associated with emotional distress
        \n\nOne thing in the moment, as multitasking will just cause further distress
        \n\nVacations will help you accumulate positive stress-reducing benefits
        \n\nEncouragement will help keep motivation levels high and help maintain focus on our chosen goals.
        \n\nOther strategies that will help emotional regulation include:
        \na) Understanding your emotions
        \nb) Allow exposure to your feelings
        \nc) Use counterconditioning procedures
        \nd) Increase positive experiences
        \ne) Increase mindfulness of current experience
        \nf) Increase competence in using coping skills

    <!--EMDR Activity Overview-->

    <string name="affectScanOverview">Use the Affect Scan on the negative cognition, asking yourself the following:
        \n\na) When you think of the incident, what is the most disturbing part?
        \n\nb) What image in the memory represents the worst part of the event? For instance, the way the person looked, or what they said, or when the person walked away. If no image represents the incident, or you were anticipating a problem, just think of the worst part.
        \n\nc) When you hold the image/incident in mind, what emotions come up for you?
        \n\nd) Where do you feel it in your body?
        \n\ne) What negative thought goes along with it?
        \n\nf) Now hold together the image and the negative thought, and feel the physical sensations in your body.
        \n\ng) Focusing on the feelings let your mind scan back to your childhood and notice the earliest memory that pops up and comes to mind where you felt the same way.
        \n\nh) On the SUD (subjective units of distress) scale (0-10), how does the old memory feel now?
        \n\ni) If you feel your body change for the worse, and/or the SUD level is 3 or higher, the memory has probably not been fully processed. If so, pick a few words to be your cue to identify the childhood memory (for instance, lost in a mall, slapped at camp, ignored by parents, alone in the basement, caught stealing in class).

    <string name="butterflyHugOverview">Cross your arms in front of you with your right hand on your left shoulder and your left hand on your right. Then you tap your hands alternately on each shoulder slowly four to six times. To try it, bring up the image of the safe or calm place along with that positive word that you’ve connected with it and allow yourself to go into that state of safety or calm. And when you have that sense, tap alternately on your thighs or with the Butterfly Hug four to six times, then stop and take a breath and see how it feels.
    </string>


    <string name="containerExerciseOverview">Bring some sort of secure container into your mind’s eye, perhaps in this room, or in another secure place. This container will be strong enough to hold all this disturbing stuff – the memories, images, thoughts, physical sensations, sounds, smells, emotions.
        \n\nWhat would this container have to be like in order to securely hold your distress? For example, it could be a safe, office drawer, shipping container, crate, or something else. Can you describe it to me? What is it? What colour is it? How big is it? What does it look like? What is it made of? What makes it safe and secure?
        \n\nNow imagine taking the distressing images and putting them inside or sending them to the container, then shut the door. Now take the distressing thoughts…… (then go through sounds, physical sensations, smells, emotions, thoughts). Anything else that needs to go in there?
        \n\nNow shut the door securely. How do we make the door more secure? OK, can you do that now? Is it secure now? Is there anything else you need to do to make it more secure? How does this feel now? Shall we leave this container in the room here, or is there a different secure place where we can leave this container? During the week (or until next time), if anything disturbing comes up, just imagine sending it here (there) and putting it all in this container.
    </string>

    <string name="floatbackOverview">
        Bring to mind a negative cognition and recent event. Where do you feel it in your body?
        \n\nAs you think of the recent incident and the negative cognition, notice the feelings in your body, and let your mind float back to childhood. What memory comes to mind when you felt that way? If something automatically comes to mind, then write it down along with your age and the SUD (Subjective Units of Distress) level.  Using cue words, list the earliest memories and the ones with the highest SUD level.
    </string>

    <string name="lightStreamOverview">The first part of the light stream technique is to be mindful of what you are experiencing and feeling in that moment. Ask yourself what emotions am I feeling right now, and where do I feel it in my body?  The second step is to imagine that those feelings are an object. The goal is to take the first thing that comes to mind after recognizing the emotions, and location. Mentally ask yourself these questions about the object: “If it had a shape, what shape would it be?” “If it had a size, what size would it be?” “If it had a color, what color would it be?” “If it had a temperature, what temperature would it be? Hot or cold?” “If it had a texture, what texture would it be?” “If it had a sound, what kind of sound would it make? High or low pitch?”
        \n\nNext, you are going to do a direct imagery exercise:  Pick a color that you most associate with healing. Imagine that there is a stream of light this color that is coming from the centre of the universe. This is a magic light, because the more you need of it, the more of it is available to you. Allow this light to flow into your head, and focus it down on the object. Let the light vibrate and resonate like a laser beam in and around this object. Allow yourself to just notice what happens to the object. Remember that the more light or energy that you need the more is available to you. Allow yourself to feel the light enter your mind, and allow the healing light again to vibrate and resonate in and around the object and notice what happens to the object.  When you notice that the object is gone or feels that it is contained, allow yourself to let the energy from the light flow into your body. Allow it to reach the tips of your finger, and the tips of your toes. Allow yourself to be engulfed, and overwhelmed by the energy, count to three and open your eyes.
    </string>

    <string name="safePlaceOverview">Imagine a positive place that you have been in the past. It should give you a feeling of safety or a feeling of calm. Bring up an image of that scene, and notice the colors and any other sense experiences that may go with it. Notice the feel of it, and notice the sensations that come up in your body—your chest, stomach, shoulders or face. If positive feelings arise, now identify a single word that would go with this feeling.
        \n\nThen close your eyes again, and bring up the image, notice the pleasant feelings, and say the word in your mind. Just notice the feelings as you allow yourself to merge into the scene while you repeat the word in your mind. Then, pay attention your breathing and make sure the breaths you take are deep breaths from your stomach.
    </string>

    <string name="spiralOverview">Think of something that is mildly upsetting. Pick something that is a 2 or 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is neutral or nothing and 10 is as bad as it could get. Think about the upsetting event.  As you think about it, ‘feel’ where the upset is appearing in the body. It may be in your chest, stomach, shoulders, back – the feeling as it appears on the body level – the body sensation of the feeling of the upset is appearing somewhere. As you feel the body sensation underneath the feeling of upset, notice the ‘energy’ of the feeling and which way it is spinning. Clockwise or counter-clockwise, just notice which way the energy spins. Notice the spinning for awhile, and then ‘spin-the-feeling-in-the-other-direction.’ When you do that, notice what happens with the feeling.

    <!--Emotional First Aid Activity Overview-->

    <string name="failureAidOverview">1) Getting Support From Others
        \n\nThe best way to grow from failure is to get support from others and have the positive lessons of the failure gently pointed out to you in the immediate aftermath of it. Just emotional support alone can validate misperceptions about oneself.  Lessons to take from failure include:
        \n\na) Failure is a great teacher
        \nb) Failure provides new opportunities
        \nc) Failure can make us stronger
        \nd) Some failures are also successes
        \ne) Failure makes future success more meaningful
        \nf) Success is not always necessary
        \n\n2) Regaining Control
        \n\nReexamine preparation and performance to that elements perceived as being out of control can be seen as such if approached differently. Exercise for this is as follows:
        \nDefine goal in realistic and specific terms
        \nBreak down the goal into intermediate steps
        \nSet timeframes to the overall and intermediate goals.
        \nList any potential detours, setbacks, or temptations and consider solutions to them.
        \n\nAnother exercise to feel more in control is as follows:
        \nDescribe the failure in question (focus on just one failure)
        \nList all the factors that contributed to your failure
        \nIdentify which factors are in your control and which are not. Go through each factor and try to view it differently - try to replace one so that it is within your control.
        \nCreate a new list of action items that are within your control.

    <string name="guiltOverview">1) Learn Recipe for Effective Apology
        \n\nA proper apology includes the following things:
        \n\na) A statement of regret for what happened;
        \nb) a clear “I’m sorry” statement;
        \nc) a request for forgiveness—all of which must be delivered with sincerity;
        \nd) validating the other person’s feelings, which is done by showcasing accuracy in conveying understanding of what happened back to the person, recognizing how they felt, acknowledging their feelings are reasonable, and conveying empathy and remorse for their emotional state;
        \ne) offering atonement or financial compensation if applicable;
        \nf) acknowledging we violated expectations to help assure it won\'t happen again
        \n\n2) Forgive Yourself For Mistakes
        \n\nIf you\'re not able to receive forgiveness from the person you wronged, don\'t let the guilt poison your every day life. Must recognize we\'ve beaten ourselves up enough and that excessive guilt serves no productive purpose going forward. The steps to attain self-forgiveness are as follows:
        \n\nAcknowledging the severity of the incident, the wrongdoings, and the impact on the person harmed both practically and emotionally. This process can be uncomfortable, if not outright painful to go through, but granting the self-forgiveness can free us in the long run. Some exercises for self-forgiveness include:
        \n\nAccountability - Describe the actions/inactions that led to the other person feeling harmed. Go through that description and take out any qualifiers/excuses from the explanation. Summarize the harm the other person sustained both emotionally and tangibly. Go through the description of harm and makes sure it is as realistic and accurate as possible. Then, consider the circumstances of the situation. Did you intend for the events to happen, and if not, what extenuating circumstances got in the way? The idea is not to excuse your actions but to understand where they came from so that you can forgive yourself.
        \n\nAtonement - Take action to minimize the likelihood of the incident occurring again. After that, identify significant tasks, contributions, or commitments that would make forgiveness feel well-earned. Make a clear mark of when you\'ve earned your self-forgiveness so that you can literally close the book on your guilt for good.
        \n\n3) Reengage in Life  When dealing with survivor\'s guilt, focus on the people and obligations remaining and empower yourself to get through that way.  When dealing with separation guilt, write a paragraph describing how you are handling a relational dynamic and focus on how self-care and proper boundaries can make you a better person overall. If dealing with disloyalty guilt, write about how you have the right to live your life as you wish and don\'t need to uphold other\'s expectations in the process.

    <string name="lonelinessOverview">1) Remove Negatively Tinted Glasses
        \n\nThe first step to removing the negative glasses is to fight pessimistic thinking by purposefully visualize scenarios of success that are both reasonable and realistic. It\'s helpful to also give benefit of the doubt by remembering that lonely people tend to assume the worst about how others feel about us. Instead, we must battle the internal tide of skepticism we feel and give the new people in our lives and the ones with whom we have existing relationships the benefit of the doubt. Lastly, taking action by doing the following exercise can help you identify avenues for social connection:
        \n\na) Go through your phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and social media contacts and make a list of people you consider friends or good acquaintances.
        \n\nb) For each person, note when you last saw or communicated with him or her and create a master list of people you haven’t been in touch with for a while.
        \n\nc) Prioritize your list by ranking all the people on it according to who in the past has made you feel best about being you. Your final ranking represents the order in which you should contact the people on your list. Reach out to at least one or two people a week and, when possible, initiate plans to meet.
        \n\nd) Go to websites that list meetings or activities and scroll through their categories, such as Meetup. Even if you don’t find a specific meet-up that fits your interests, such sites are good places to get ideas for activities or hobbies that might intrigue you.
        \n\ne) Identify at least three activities or topics you might want to pursue (e.g., book clubs, adult education classes, hiking or biking groups). Search online for meetings in your area.
        \n\n2) Identify Self-Defeating Behaviors
        \n\nTake time to reflect on how you might come across to your friends, colleagues, and loved ones or when you are on a date or any other type of social engagement. Try to identify at least three behaviors (including omissions, such as not conveying interest), even if they seem entirely justified and even if they seem relatively minor, that might be pushing other people away.
        \n\na) My self-defeating behaviors are: ____
        \n\nb) Once you’ve identified what you might be doing incorrectly, be extremely mindful of avoiding such behaviors in the future. Keep your list handy and read it before you attend social engagements. Self-defeating mechanisms can be changed once you have identified them correctly but do not expect to eliminate them all at once.
        \n\n3) Take Other Person\'s Perspective
        \n\na) Failing to Engage Our Perspective-taking Muscles When We Should
        \n\nTry to understand the other person\'s perspective - how they might see things, react to an action you take, or how their values and agenda may vary from your own.
        \n\nb) Favoring Our Own Point of View\n\nBy not giving other people\'s perspective proper weight, it\'s far more likely to cause social strife in communication, whether it be in person or through electronic communications.
        \n\nc) Considering the Wrong Information
        \n\nBe sure to consider accurate information as opposed to inaccurate information (such as broad stereotypes or gossip). Judge the person based on who they are and not preconceived notions.
        \n\n4) Deepen Emotional Bonds With Others
        \n\nThe best way to deepen emotional bonds is to practice empathy for others. These empathy muscles can be strengthened by visualizing yourself in the other person\'s shoes and knowing the context with which they might see a situation. Then, convey the insights you gained by showcasing your understanding in a compassionate and convincing manner.
        \n\n5) Create Opportunities for Social Connection
        \n\nIf hesitant to attend new events, a way to circumvent that is to attend with another purpose in mind besides socializing. For example, one could attend a biking group if they were training for a triathlon. This way, the pressure isn\'t entirely put on socializing. Other avenues that can be used for meeting people include the Internet and volunteering.
        \n\n6) Adopt a Best Friend
        \n\nIf one is rural, lacks the mobility to get out into the community, or for other reasons has a hard time socializing on a regular basis, pets are a great way to help mitigate the feelings of loneliness. Just be aware that owning a pet (especially a dog) is a huge responsibility that should not be taken lightly, if that is the avenue one decides to take.

    <string name="rejectionOverview">1) Argue with Self-Criticism
        \n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the but-rebuttal method mentioned in the CBT section. A general method can be followed:
        \n\na) List (in writing) any negative or self-critical thoughts you have about the rejection.
        \n\nb) Use the following self-criticism “counterarguments” from a variety of rejection scenarios to formulate personalized rebuttals to each of the self-criticisms you listed. Feel free to list more than one counterargument per self-critical thought when it is relevant to do so.  Whenever you have a self-critical thought, make sure to immediately articulate the relevant counterargument(s) fully and clearly in your mind.
        \n\nFor example, a relevant argument for romantic rejection involves assuming that the pairing is just a bad fit, rather than related to any personal shortcomings. For workplace rejection, remember job hunting is generally an employee-unfriendly process where job rejection is inevitable, and when in a job, remember that rejection by colleagues may be related to the culture of the company or attempting to appeal to superiors. For social rejections, keep in mind that you may have outgrown the social group you were previously a part of, or may have different values that make it hard to be close with them.
        \n\n2) Revive Self-Worth
        \n\na) Make a written list of five characteristics, attributes, or traits you value highly that you have. Keep your list relevant to the area that the rejection occurred. It is important to take the time to think about qualities that really matter to you (for example, if you’ve been rejected by a romantic partner and you know the following qualities to be true you might list items such as caring, loyal, good listener, considerate, and emotionally available). Rank your list of characteristics according to their order of importance to you.
        \n\nb) Choose two of the top three attributes you listed and write a short essay (one or two paragraphs) about each one, covering the following points:
        \n• Why the specific quality is important to you
        \n• How this attribute influences your life
        \n• Why this attribute is an important part of your self-image
        \n\n3) Replenish Feelings of Social Connection
        \n\nEven though the pain of rejection may make us not want to engage with others, it is worthwhile to have a strong support system in place to help mitigate stressful events. Ways to replenish feelings of social connection are to find new affiliations with a better fit for the person you are currently, and to recall past positive experiences.
        \n\n4) Densensitize Yourself
        \n\nUse only if in a good mental state! The more one is exposed to situations that are deemed uncomfortable or unpleasant, the less they end up disturbing us. For situations like asking people out on dates, calling prospective employers for jobs, applying to internships or other educational programs, or initiating new friendships, desensitization can be a great tool to work past fears of rejection in various realms.

    <string name="ruminationOverview">1) Change perspective
        \n\nRather than view things from a first-person point of view (which causes a narrative of the experience to replay), view the rumination-causing events in the third person to get a more realistic perspective on the situation.  To visualize the situation differently, imagine a snapshot of the situation that is causing rumination. Zoom out the scene slowly until you\'re a passerby in the situation who happens to see it, rather than a direct participant.
        \n\n2) Distract yourself from the emotional pain
        \n\nRepressing the thought urges is an ineffective measure, however distraction is an effective mechanism for breaking a rumination spell. Some effective methods of distraction include video games, reading, socializing, and exercise. When time is short, spending a few minutes on a short puzzle or imagining the layout of a supermarket broke the train of rumination. The best method of distraction will vary depending on setting and the ruminative memory, so through trial and error figure out which method of distraction is appropriate for the current situation.  To identify potential distractions, list the places and situations where you ruminate most often, and with each place you ruminate, list as many short and long distractions as possible. Once the list is complete, carry it with you so that you can refer to it in times of rumination.
        \n\n3) Reframe Anger
        \n\nThe catharsis model of dealing with anger (ie, hitting things when angry) has been found to be counterproductive when coping with anger. The best way to deal with anger is to instead reframe it, which can be done by doing the following:  Find the positive intention in the situation that\'s causing anger
        \n\nIdentify opportunities for improvement
        \n\nEmbrace the learning moment
        \n\nView the offender as needing help
        \n\n4) Go Easy On Friends
        \n\nEnsure that balanced mutual emotional support provided
        \n\nDo not ruminate same topic to them endlessly as they will expect you to move on past a certain point
        \n\nMake sure that conversations are not constantly serious and have some light-hearted moments and fun included in them.
    </string>

    <string name="selfEsteemOverview">1) Adopt Self-Compassion
        \n\nThe critical voice in one\'s head can be devastating to cope with. Being empathetic to our own experiences goes a lot further than criticizing ourselves to death. To learn more about self-compassion, check out Kristin Neff\'s work at https://self-compassion.org/
        \n\n2) Identify And Affirm Strengths
        \n\nRather than use positive affirmations, which try to confirm qualities we\'d like to have but don\'t believe that we have, identify self-affirmations that identify valuable aspects of ourselves we know to be true and can\'t be taken away from us even if we fail. An exercise to follow to enforce this practice is as follows:  Grab two sheets of paper. On the first list your important attributes and qualities, including any achievements you deem significant. If negative thoughts crop up while coming up with positive achievements, write them on the second sheet of paper.  Choose one item from the first sheet that is especially meaningful to you and write a brief essay about why the achievement is meaningful. Then take the second sheet of paper, crumple it up, and throw it in the garbage. On following days, choose other items from your positive list of attributes and write about those as well.
        \n\n3) Increase Tolerance for Compliments
        \n\nA writing exercise to become more accepting of compliments is as follows:
        \n\nThink back to a time when someone expressed appreciation for either a personal quality that you have or something that you did. Describe the incident and what made the person feel positively about you when it occurred.
        \n\nWhat does displaying this attribute or behavior mean to you?
        \n\nWhat benefits does having the attribute or behavior bring to your relationships and friendships?
        \n\nWhat other significant or meaningful functions or roles can the attribute or behavior contribute to your life?
        \n\n4) Increase Personal Empowerment
        \n\nAn exercise to identify areas to be more assertive are as follows:
        \n\nThink about aspects of your life that make you frustrated. Include your social life, family life, work life, personal life, and community life. Describe three examples from each of those domains. Rank your items according to which you have both a high likelihood of success and manageable consequences in case of failure.
        \n\nAfter creating your list, do some strategic planning. Understand the mindsets of relevant people around and the structure of any bureaucracy you may need to approach. Then think through the plan of action and anticipate any reactions to the best of your ability. Then, use practice, persistence, and patience to develop personal empowerment. As more successes develop, they will snowball and lead to increased overall self-esteem.
        \n\n5) Strengthening Self-Control
        \n\nWillpower is a finite resource; in order to maximize its effectiveness, we need to strengthen our basic willpower muscles, manage the energy reservoirs that fuel our self-control so they aren\'t depleted, and minimize the impact of the many temptations that exist around us.
        \n\nFor example, to strengthen willpower, doing something like using your non-dominant hand requires you to regularly inhabit an automatic impulse. (If using your non-dominant hand isn\'t feasible, can also resist the urge to curse, eat sweets, and/or slouch to break the automatic habits.) Try to stick to this new schedule for 4 to 8 weeks, following the habit-breaking mechanism for as long as possible throughout the day.
        \n\nTo best manage energy resources, keep diet balanced so that the body doesn\'t experience sugar crashes.
        \n\nThe best way to preserve willpower, however, is to avoid temptations and to manage them when one is unable to. When one is unable to avoid temptations, do the following:
        \n\nPlay one side of the brain against the other - when feeling tempted to give into a craving or addiction, logically recall the reasons it would be bad to give back into that habit.
        \n\nMinimize the damage - When slipping back into an old habit, treat it as a willpower muscle running out rather than as an excuse to start over entirely.
        \n\nAvoiding Triggers - Many bad habits are prompted by triggers. (Ex, eating popcorn is associated with watching a movie.) Reading up on the Habits section in this app can help you understand more about how to build better habits overall.
        \n\nLastly, practicing mindfulness can help one understand when craving develop and learn how to tolerate the urges and impulses associated with them.

    <string name="traumaOverview">1) Soothe Your Emotional Pain
        \n\nDepending on your personality, either talking about the traumatic experience or distancing yourself from the experience. Either way, time will help to heal all wounds.
        \n\n2) Recover Lost Aspects of Self
        \n\nWhen trauma occurs it is very easy to lose parts of oneself as certain people, places, or activities are associated with the trauma. An exercise to help recover these lost aspects is as follows (caution: only do this exercise if the trauma is still fresh and the distress you\'re feeling is extreme):
        \n\nList qualities, characteristics, and abilities you value in yourself or others value in you before events occurred (write down at least 10 things). Then notice which ones have become less prominent since the trauma, and then write a paragraph describing why you feel disconnected from the specific attribute. And for each quality, write a paragraph describing possible people, outlets, or activities to pursue that would allow you to express the quality in a more substantial way than you are able to currently. Then rank the items and tackle the ones that are the most doable and emotionally manageable.
        \n\n3) Find Meaning in Tragedy
        \n\nThere are two phases to getting over tragedy, and these include sense making and benefit finding. Sense finding helps one to make sense of the tragedy, and involves asking why, not how when thinking about the tragedy. Making sense also involves asking what might have been (which is an incredibly painful exercise that should only be done once one is far along in recovery and believes in fate) and giving the actual outcome of the events more meaning as a result.
        \n\nBenefit finding requires considering the potential benefits of the loss, which can happen in later stages of recovery. An exercise to help identify benefits includes imagining yourself 10 years in the future. Imagine that you obtain something significant and are looking back on your life. Imagine answering the following questions:
        \n\nI never imagined back then that tragic events would lead to ___.  What I did was significant because ___.  The first step of my journey toward the achievement was when I ___.  My achievement was possible because I changed my priorities such that ___.  Changing my priorities led me to make the following changes in my life: ___. Along the way I realized my purpose was to ___.

    <!--IFS Activity Overview-->

    <string name="earlyChildhoodTraumaOverview">Many people grow up thinking that they mistakenly grew up in a normal household, when in reality their family could be considered a low-nurturance family. Signs that one trusts their family is as follows:  As a child, you felt safe, appreciated, enjoyed, supported, respected (ie, loved) unconditionally.
        \n\nAs a child you trusted your caregiver to consistently and genuinely care about major needs, fears, and hurts and to help protect the child against these things.
        \n\nGenuine praise, appreciation, and encouragement are spontaneously exchanged often amongst the family.
        \n\nThere were no major taboos or family secrets that can\'t be talked about in the family.
        \n\nThe family followed a healthy grieving policy for coping with life\'s disappointments and losses.
        \n\nThe family has a steady feeling of spontaneous teamwork and cooperation exists most of the time (as opposed to competition)
        \n\nFamily adults are committed to learning, teaching, and using effective thinking, communicating, and problem-solving skills within the family and outside of it.
        \n\nFamily members are not caught up in long-standing addictions and can be present for the children that are around them
        \n\nSo would you describe your upbringing as being high-nurturance? If not, don\'t fret - most people can\'t. However, by growing up in a low-nurturance household, it is possible that you have inherited psychological wounds that need to heal. So check out that section for more information. Another resource to refer to if you feel your childhood wasn\'t up to snuff is Jonice Webb\'s Running on Empty, which focuses on the issue of Childhood Emotional Neglect, where parents take care of a child\'s physical needs but completely ignore their emotional ones.

    <string name="partsWorkOverview">Once one has a list of personality subselves developed, the meat and potatoes of IFS therapy begins. Some common methods used in IFS are as follows:
        \n\n1) Create a parts-work journal - this is where subselves can vent and record their experiences and discoveries.
        \n\n2) Choose an inspiring role model to look up to - that is, identify someone who appears to be well-balanced, healthy, confident in their own skin, nurturing, and productive in their every day lives.
        \n\n3) Use informational internal interviews to get to know your parts better, as well as understand certain ones that are living in the past.
        \n\n4) Redoing is a powerful parts work technique that involves planning and rehearsing, then vividly recalling a past real-life trauma, and revisiting it in the present with as many subselves as deemed necessary/helpful. The goal is to intervene safely in the remembered traumatic process and to help the affected subselves experience a safer outcome to the incident in the present.
        \n\n5) Rescuing - a form of redoing, and is a key parts work technique. It involves identifying parts living in the past, patiently gaining their trust, preparing a safe, nurturing (inner) place for them in the present, and helping them transfer safely out of their traumatic environment to join other subselves in the real present. Rescuing paralyzed or exiled parts can help thaw frozen grief, heal toxic old shame, and see the world as it really is. A symptom of a successful rescue is having life-long fears, anxieties, and frustrations permanently recede.

    <string name="personalitySubselvesOverview">Ever have an argument with yourself? Ever notice part of you wants to eat a sweet treat but another part is insisting that you shouldn\'t have it? These are your inner voices having a dialogue with each other, and these inner voices are known as personality subselves. The main way to heal from psychological wounds is to become familiar with one\'s subselves and understand what their needs and purpose are. This process is intentional and will likely take multiple years to fully complete, given there are many subselves that the average person has.
        \n\nSubselves can be categorized into three parts:
        \n\nManagers
        \n\nManagers are the main subselves that run the show when the rest of your parts feel safe and satisfied enough. A typical list of manager subselves can be seen here: http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/managers.htm
        \n\nInner Kids
        \n\nInner children are the developmentally young parts of oneself, which tend to be reactive and naive about the state of the current world. When unsupervised, these subselves can hurt yourself or others, so other subselves try to take care of them. A list of inner child subselves can be seen here: http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/kids.htm
        \n\nGuardians
        \n\nGuardians are the ever-watchful subset of our subselves that make sure that they don\'t step out of line. A list of Guardian subselves can be seen here: http://sfhelp.org/gwc/pop/guardians.htm
        \n\nTo heal from long-term psychological wounds it\'s essential to create a list of one\'s own personality subselves and understand how they affect one as a whole.

    <string name="psychologicalWoundsOverview">Psychological wounds generally carry on between generations. This is, if your parents have a lot of psychological wounds, you may have inherited some of them as well, albeit unintentionally. Most people will rationalize, distract, and numb themselves from the psychic pain that they are feeling on a regular basis, and this can showcase in a variety of destructive manners (addiction, workaholism, etc). Common signs one has been psychologically wounded:   1) Excessive shame and guilt   2) Excessively fearful   3) Significant distortions of reality   4)Excessive trust or distrust   5) Difficulty feeling, empathizing, and bonding with other living things.   To be able to effectively heal one\'s wounds, according to IFS it\'s essential to become connected one\'s various subselves, and how to do that is in the next section. However, the main tenets for recovery from psychological wounds are as follows:   1) Awareness - wanting to become habitually conscious of what one thinks, feels and needs in the moment over time, and awareness of how one behaves in various relationships and situations now and over time.   2) Knowledge about  a) early-childhood abandonment, neglect, and trauma  b) personality subselves and how to harmonize them  c) apply communication, grieving, and relationship basics to their every day lives.   3) Stable motivation to change   4) Healthy Spiritual Growth and Faith   5) Admit and control any addictions   6) Exist in a pro-recovery environment   7) Be curious about the process of healing and access further resources</string>


    <!--MBSR Activity Overview-->

    <string name="bodyScanOverview">The body scan is a powerful form of meditation that encourages you to be aware of how your body is feeling in the current moment. The general gist is that you end up giving devoted attention to each part of your body, starting from the base of your skull and going all the way down to your toes, while hitting everywhere in-between. The sensations in the body tend to be felt more acutely by giving them our full attention, but by doing so we also allow our body to process the feeling associated with the sensation too. Emotional reactions and thoughts will also inevitably appear while doing this exercise, but just be aware of these things popping up and instead to practice acceptance. Some body scan meditations (of varying lengths) are linked below:

        \n<b>STOP</b>
        \n\nStands for stop, take a moment, observe and proceed. When you\'re feeling overwhelmed, this acronym can help you to react in a healthier manner. For a more detailed description of the acronym, it suggests to stop what you\'re doing and put things down for a minute, take a few deep breaths, observe your current experience as is, and proceed with an activity that will better your well-being.
        \n\n<b>Traits of Emotional Hunger</b> - emotional and physical hunger can feel identical if you haven\'t learned how to tell the two apart. Ways to tell the two apart:
        \n\nEmotional Hunger is sudden, generally is a craving for a certain food, is based in the mind and mouth, is urgent, is paired with an upsetting emotion, involves automatic or absent-minded eating, does not notice or stop eating in response to fullness, and feels guilty about eating.
        \n\nPhysical hunger is gradual, open to eating different foods, is based in the stomach, does not need to be satiated immediately, occurs out of physical need, involves deliberate choices and awareness of eating, stops eating when full, and realizes eating is necessary.
        \n\nAnother way to track your hunger is to use a hunger fullness scale, where 0 is where your stomach is entirely empty and 10 is where you\'re unbearably full. Generally, you want your hunger and fullness range to be from about a 3 to a 7 (moderately hungry to moderately full), as it\'s easier to ensure you don\'t hit the extreme ranges of hunger, which will make it much more likely to overeat and get stuffed. By having mindful awareness of one\'s hunger levels it\'s easier to maintain a diet and stay satiated throughout the day.

    <!--Schema Activity Overview-->

    <string name="abandonmentOverview">Fear of losing those closest to them. Clinging to friends, jealousy, competitiveness, refusing to engage in intimate relationships. Commonly linked with Defectiveness, Abandonment, Dependence/Incompetence, and Subjugation.
        \n\nTreatment: Realize that people won\'t leave on a whim. Internalize partners as stable objects. Will be able to be on one\'s own for an extended period of time and not feel the need to reach out and connect to someone immediately. Learn to keep relationships that are stable and productive rather than attempt to survive on ones that will flounder.
    </string>

    <string name="approvalSeekingSchemaOverview">A person with a Need for Approval schema has gotten deeply involved with and affected by the idea that love needs to be won from other people, that it is not something that they deserve or are entitled to automatically, and that they can’t fill that void themselves. Need for Approval schemas often arise in childhood, when children feel that a parents or other important figures in their lives only show love or affection when the child is behaving a certain way. These people seek approval at the expense of expressing themselves authentically and fulfilling their core needs.
        \n\nTreatment: Focus on accomplishments as opposed to flaws. Tackle cognitive distortions that feed attention-seeking and spineless behavior. Need to develop the ability to be emotionally self-sufficient.
    </string>

    <string name="defectivenessOverview">The feeling that one is defective, bad, unwanted, inferior, or invalid in important respects; or that one would be unlovable to significant others if exposed. May involve hypersensitivity to criticism, rejection, and blame; self-consciousness, comparisons, and insecurity around others; or a sense of shame regarding one\'s perceived flaws. These flaws may be private (e.g., selfishness, angry impulses, unacceptable sexual desires) or public (e.g., undesirable physical appearance, social awkwardness). Related closely to impostor syndrome.
        \n\nTreatment: Tackle the cognitive distortion of feeling inferior and defective.
    </string>

    <string name="dependencyOverview">Incompetence: Lacking faith in decisions and judgments about everyday life. Hate/fear facing change alone, unable to tackle tasks alone and need someone to show what to do.
        \n\nDependence: Finding people to take care of them, or just not functioning at all whatsoever. Waiting for someone else to show them the way. Difficulty traveling alone, asking for advice. Worrisome tradeoff - becoming counterdependent and doing everything on one\'s own.
        \n\nTreatment: Building confidence and skills, trying to do things alone. Will end up not relying on others to unhealthy degree afterwards. Learn to trust own intuition and judgments rather than relying on others.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalDeprivationOverview">Feel they do not get enough affection, attention, or deep emotions expressed. Feel misunderstood and alone in the world. Deprivation of Nurturance (nobody is there to hold them, pay attention to them, or give physical affection), Deprivation of Empathy (nobody is there who listens or understands who they are and how they feel), Deprivation of Protection (nobody is there to protect/guid them, despite offering as much for others). No expressing desire for love or comfort, focusing on other person but not talking about self, acting stronger than one actually is, and acting as if there are no emotional needs, so emotional needs are not fulfilled. Choosing/being attracted to partners who are cold, aloof, or needy/self-centered, so relationship is draining. Either stay in distant relationships or avoid them entirely.
        \n\nTreatment: Become aware of emotional needs, and accept that they are natural and right. Get needs for nurturance, empathy, and protection met. Choose appropriate people to open up to and ask for needs in appropriate ways. Be able to be both strong and vulnerable.
    </string>

    <string name="emotionalInhibitionOverview">Inhibited/scared of discussing one\'s emotions. Restrains/suppressing of emotions. Fear of being vulnerable to others. Valuing self-control above all else. By expressing emotions and being oneself will be afraid of abandonment and punishment. Can result in excessive dependence on rationality with disregard for one\'s own emotional needs. Rigid to routine rather than spontaneous. Can be result of shame when expressing emotion as a child.
        \n\nTreatment: Learn to become emotionally expressive and more spontaneous. Appropriately deal with anger, engage in leisure, express affection, and talk about feelings. Predict how expressing emotions will go and note the results.
    </string>

    <string name="enmeshmentOverview">Excessive emotional involvement and closeness with one or more significant others (often parents), at the expense of full individuation or normal social development. Often involves the belief that at least one of the enmeshed individuals cannot survive or be happy without the constant support of the other. May also include feelings of being smothered by, or fused with, others OR insufficient individual identity. Often experienced as a feeling of emptiness and floundering, having no direction, or in extreme cases questioning one\'s existence.
        \n\nTreatment: Must feel it\'s okay to become untangled from others and thrive on their own. Must discover own preferences and identity through mindfulness and establishing boundaries.
    </string>


    <string name="entitlementOverview">Sometimes considered grandiosity and superiority. Feels they are owed something from existing and act superior to others. Can be from a spoiled childhood or feeling deprived of one.
        \n\nTreatment: Use CBT to tackle the distortions and should statements inherent to feeling entitled (ie, feeling one should have money/comfort/etc).
    </string>

    <string name="failureSchemaOverview">The belief that one has failed, will inevitably fail, or is fundamentally inadequate relative to one\'s peers, in areas of achievement (school, career, sports, etc.). Often involves beliefs that one is stupid, inept, untalented, ignorant, lower in status, less successful than others, etc.
        \n\nTreatment: Overcoming a failure schema requires both facing the fear of failure and refuting the idea that failure is inevitable. Recognize cognitive distortions in thoughts and then one can think about failure in a less catastrophic manner.
    </string>

    <string name="healthyBoundariesOverview">You can say no or yes, and you are okay when others say no to you.
        \n\nYou have a strong sense of identity.

    <string name="hypercriticalnessOverview">The underlying belief that one must strive to meet very high internalized standards of behavior and performance, usually to avoid criticism. Typically results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down; and in hypercriticalness toward oneself and others. Must involve significant impairment in: pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, or satisfying relationships. Unrelenting standards typically present as: a) perfectionism, inordinate attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one\'s own performance is relative to the norm; b) rigid rules and shoulds in many areas of life, including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts; or c) preoccupation with time and efficiency, so that more can be accomplished.
        \n\nTreatment: Make risks seem less scary to take, pick up a hobby, choose to do things imperfectly, and do a cost-benefit analysis on effort given to specific tasks.
    </string>

    <string name="insufficientOverview">Has zero impulse control and difficulty facing challenges. Too focused on immediate gratification and unable to pursue long-term goals. Commonly related to the Subjugation Schema.
        \n\nTreatment: Must recognize when schema is kicking in and act rationally. Prioritize long-term goals and work towards them above all else.
    </string>

    <string name="mistrustOverview">Generally expect bad treatment from others. They tend to think or say that they always get the worst of things, that other people want to do them harm, or that it’s not safe to trust others. Having a Mistrust Schema means feeling deep down, on a gut level, regardless of logic, that other people cannot be trusted, that the only safety is in keeping others at a distance. The Mistrust Schema generally is built early in life in response to abuse, whether emotional, physical, or sexual, by a person in authority or by anyone who is deeply trusted. A child who is mistreated will often naturally adopt a strategy of assuming the worst of other people in order not to be put in a vulnerable position again if it can be helped.
        \n\nTreatment: Must consciously trust others. Must notice how being so distrustful shuts one off from opportunities in life. Must resist fortune-telling and assume what other people think of them.
    </string>

    <string name="negativityOverview">Amplifying the negative things in life to the expense of the positive ones. Fear of making critical mistake to ruin life, living in constant anxiety. Chronically tense and regularly complaining and indecisive. Compensates for the Emotional Deprivation schema.
        \n\nTreatment: Try not to prepare constantly for the worst case scenario. Take a slightly more optimistic than realistic take on things. Try to not ruminate obsessively on future scenarios and grilling yourself for past mistakes. Ask people to meet emotional needs in relationships rather than take maladaptive strategies to have needs met. Schedule time designated for worrying. Remember negative events in the past do not inform events occurring in the future.
    </string>

    <string name="punitivenessOverview">Related to the Unrelenting Standards and Defectiveness schema. Involves punishing yourself for not living up to impossible standards or for being broken/bad. This means you are unable to forgive yourself and others for mistakes and believe that they deserve punishment. Can be self-directed or directed at others.
        \n\nTreatment: Question person\'s intentions first before deciding on either doing punishment or forgiveness. Work on practicing self-forgiveness and then extend it to others in a similar way. Do not let taking responsibility for one\'s actions derail attempts of forgiveness.
    </string>

    <string name="schemaCopeModesOverview">Compliant Surrenderer - appear passive and dependent. Feel helpless in face of what\'s ahead. Obedient to the point of allowing abuse.
        \n\nDetached Protector - shut down from others in order to protect themselves from pain of being vulnerable. May feel numb or empty. Act aloof or cynical to avoid being invested in people or other activities. Behaviors include social withdrawal, excessive self-reliance, addictive self-soothing, fantasizing, compulsive distraction, and stimulation seeking.
        \n\nOvercompensator - act as if the opposite of the schema were true, when one is being impacted. Try to maintain strict order, self-control, or immense predictability through planning and routine.

    <string name="schemaEmotionsOverview">1. Identifying and Awareness of Emotions/Feelings
        \n\nWhat feelings/sensations do I have? Where in my body am I feeling it? in my chest? throat? stomach? What thoughts am I having that indicate what I might be feeling? Are there any contradicting thoughts / feelings? Do I have any judgments on the thoughts/feelings I have? Am I having any urges to suppress/move away from these feelings? Why?
        \n\n2. Ability to Stay With and Accept Feelings in Order to Process
        \n\nIs this feeling intolerable? Why do I think it is intolerable? Do I think something bad will happen if I allow this feeling? What? How bad is it on a scale of 1 to 10? Am I having distressing physiological sensations? What can I do to tolerate this state? (breathe / relax / stay still?)
        \n\n3. Process to Act on Emotion Properly
        \n\nAre there any needs that are going unmet? (ie, do I feel misunderstood / unheard / disrespected?) Has a boundary been violated by someone? Has a value been compromised? What is my contribution to this distress? Am I falling into old behaviour patterns? Is this emotional distress as a result of distorted thinking? Is this emotion the triggering of childhood memories? Is this distress a result of me not accepting my feeling or judging it as wrong? Is this distress from a build-up of different events?

    <string name="schemaTreatmentOverview">1) Identifying Alternative Schemas - Ask questions such as: How would you like things to be? How would you like yourself, others or the world to be? If people weren’t [ ], how would you like them to be?
        \n\n2) Limited Reparenting - Provide experiences through therapy that were missed in early childhood through empathic confrontation.
        \n\n3) Guided Imagery - Bring up upsetting childhood memories in form of images, emotional expression and grieving are encouraged. Identify need that weren\'t met and how maladaptive schemas were formed, connect to current situation that is triggering current maladaptive schema.
        \n\n4) Positive Data Log and Schema Diary - Keep daily log of observations that are consistent with new adaptive schema, and how what person learns during therapy is applied until next therapy session.
        \n\n5) Flash Cards - written statements that help access healthy side and internalize/enforce healthy schema formation and disarm negative schemas.
        \n\n6) Continuum Methods - schemas represent absolute thinking, Adaptive Continuum (see on scale from 0 to 100 where thinking is on a continuum), Criteria Continua (break down personality characteristic into several subcriteria and see where you fall in that), and Two Dimensional Charting of Continua (when concepts are connected, chart a predicted graph and find exceptions to rule).
        \n\n7) Psychodrama, Role-Playing, and Chair Work - psychodrama (remember early childhood scene that caused schema to form and activate, causes strong emotional reaction). Re-experience event with roleplaying where protect self with adult voice. Chair work has one side be the schema and the other be the healthy, and a dialogue ensues.
        \n\n8) Historical Test of Schema - Make two separate lists, one for confirming and one for disconfirming evidence for schema for different age periods.

    <string name="selfSacrificeOverview">Putting other people\'s needs above one\'s own, and repressing one\'s own needs/not relying on others. Leads to feeling resentful, unappreciated, and undervalued.
        \n\nTreatment: To fight back, put one\'s own needs above others and enforce strict boundaries to maintain self-care strategies. Will need to learn how to say no and accept help from others.</string>

    <string name="socialIsolationOverview">Feeling like one doesn\'t belong anywhere. Brings about feelings of loneliness and no sense of security/safety.
        \n\nTreatment: Need to tackle negative thoughts holding one back, especially mind reading cognitive distortions. Can accept one won\'t belong in every group, but will be able to find a place to belong.
    </string>

    <string name="subjugationOverview">Feels an overpowering obligation to submit to another person’s will, to be told what to do and be judged by someone else. Often such a person will believe in their heart that they need to do what another person says in order to be loved, valuable, etc., and/or will be afraid that they will be judged harshly or punished if they don’t fall in line. Having the subjugation schema means burying or ignoring one’s own needs, desires, inclinations, judgments, and beliefs–whether this is happening due to giving in to others or to being preoccupied with rebelling against others, as in both cases the person with the subjugation schema is reacting to others’ needs, desires, and actions instead of their own.
        \n\nTreatment: Learn to be more assertive and communicative about boundaries. Practice mindfulness to be more aware of one\'s own thoughts/emotions. Take down cognitive distortions feeding into related behavior.
    </string>

    <string name="vulnerabilityOverview">Fear of a catastrophe that will overwhelm one\'s life, so one must be overly vigilant in fear against it occurring.
        \n\nTreatment: Must accept the idea of harm may occur, even if the odds are small, and rejecting an obsession with harm.
