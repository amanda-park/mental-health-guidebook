    <string name="cbtdesc">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a method of therapy that focuses on challenging and changing unhelpful cognitive distortions (e.g. thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and behaviors that might affect someone. By recognizing the distorted thoughts and developing healthy coping mechanisms that target solving current problems, one will begin to experience relief from symptoms. Originally, it was designed to treat depression, but its use has been expanded to include treatment of a number of mental health conditions, including anxiety.</string>
